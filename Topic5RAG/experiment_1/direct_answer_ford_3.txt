  Question: How can you tell if your car's engine needs an oil change?
  Answer: You can check for signs that your car's engine needs an oil change by looking at the dipstick. If the oil level is below the minimum mark or it has changed color (usually dark brown), then it's time for an oil change. Additionally, listen for any unusual noises coming from the engine while driving; these could be indicators of worn-out bearings or other components needing attention. Lastly, inspect the coolant level and condition; if it looks dirty or there are leaks, it may need replacing as well. Always consult your vehicle owner manual for specific recommendations based on your make and model.
