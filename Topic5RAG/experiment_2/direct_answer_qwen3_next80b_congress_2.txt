Question: What is the purpose of the Main Street Parity Act?



The **Main Street Parity Act** (enacted as **Section 203 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018**) is a U.S. federal law designed to **reduce excessive regulatory burdens on small community banks** while maintaining safety and soundness in the financial system. Its core purpose is to ensure that regulations tailored for large, systemically important banks do not unfairly apply to smaller institutions that pose minimal risk to the broader economy.

### Key Problems It Addresses:
- After the 2008 financial crisis, regulations like the **Dodd-Frank Act** imposed strict rules (e.g., the Volcker Rule, stress testing, capital requirements) on all banks above certain asset thresholds.  
- These rules were designed for massive Wall Street banks (e.g., those with >$50 billion in assets), but they were initially applied to smaller community banks with far less risk.  
- Compliance costs for these smaller banks became disproportionately high, forcing them to divert resources from lending to local businesses and consumers, and in some cases, leading to bank closures or reduced services in rural/underserved areas.

### How the Act Works:
1. **Exempts Small Banks from the Volcker Rule**:  
   - The Volcker Rule (part of Dodd-Frank) restricts banks from engaging in proprietary trading (trading for their own profit).  
   - The Main Street Parity Act **exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets** from this rule entirely.  
   - *Why?* Small community banks rarely engage in complex proprietary trading; this exemption eliminates costly compliance burdens without increasing systemic risk.

2. **Raises Thresholds for Other Regulations**:  
   - The law also increased asset thresholds for other Dodd-Frank requirements (e.g., stress testing, capital buffers), so only banks with **over $100 billion in assets** face the most stringent rules.  
   - For example:  
     - Annual stress tests now apply only to banks with >$100 billion in assets (up from $50 billion).  
     - Certain liquidity requirements are eased for banks below $10 billion.  

### Intended Outcomes:
- **Lower Compliance Costs**: Smaller banks save millions in regulatory overhead (e.g., hiring specialists, software, audits), freeing up capital for local lending.  
- **Preserve Community Banking**: Helps small banks remain competitive against larger institutions, ensuring continued access to credit for Main Street businesses, farmers, and families.  
- **Focus on Real Risks**: Shifts regulatory focus to banks that actually threaten financial stability (e.g., "too big to fail" institutions), while tailoring rules to the actual risk profile of community banks.  

### Why "Main Street"?  
The term "Main Street" symbolizes local businesses and communities served by small banks, contrasting with "Wall Street" (large financial institutions). The Act aims to restore "parity" by ensuring regulations are proportionate to risk—not one-size-fits-all.  

> 💡 **Real-World Impact**: A community bank with $5 billion in assets no longer needs to spend $1–2 million annually on Volcker Rule compliance. Instead, it can lend more to small businesses, fund home loans, or support local infrastructure projects—strengthening the local economy without compromising safety.

### Criticism & Context:
- **Supporters** (e.g., community banks, small-business groups) argue it prevents overregulation that harms economic growth in rural/urban neighborhoods.  
- **Critics** (e.g., some consumer advocates) worry it could weaken oversight, though the law explicitly preserves core safety standards for all banks.  
- The Act is part of broader bipartisan efforts to "right-size" regulations—recognizing that not all banks pose the same risks.  

In short: **The Main Street Parity Act ensures that regulations match the scale and risk of the bank, protecting small community banks from burdens they don’t need while keeping the financial system stable.**
