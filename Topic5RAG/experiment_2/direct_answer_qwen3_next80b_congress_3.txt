Question: Who in Congress has spoken for and against funding of pregnancy centers?



The question of **federal funding for pregnancy centers** (often called "crisis pregnancy centers" or CPCs) requires important context before discussing specific members of Congress. **There is no direct federal funding for CPCs under current law**, and most federal programs that support reproductive health explicitly exclude CPCs due to their opposition to abortion and lack of comprehensive services (e.g., no abortions, no referrals for abortion, and often no contraception). However, debates about *indirect* funding or proposed legislation have occurred. Below is a clear breakdown:

---

### **Key Context: Federal Funding for CPCs**
- **CPCs do NOT receive federal funding** through major programs like **Title X** (family planning) or **Medicaid**. Title X regulations explicitly prohibit funding for organizations that provide abortions or refer for abortions (CPCs fall into this category). 
- CPCs primarily rely on **state-level funding, private donations, or religious organizations**. Some states (e.g., Texas, Florida, Ohio) allocate state funds to CPCs, but this is **not a federal issue**.
- In Congress, debates about CPC funding typically involve:
  - **Proposed bills** to create new federal funding streams for CPCs (e.g., "alternatives to abortion" programs).
  - **Amendments to block grants** (e.g., Community Services Block Grant) that could allow states to use federal funds for CPCs.
  - **Efforts to defund abortion providers** (e.g., Planned Parenthood), which some argue would indirectly redirect funds to CPCs (though this is not how funding works in practice).

### **Members of Congress Who Have Advocated for CPC Funding**
These lawmakers support **new federal funding for CPCs** or **allowing states to use federal grants for CPCs**. They are typically Republicans who frame CPCs as providing "pro-life alternatives" to abortion.

1. **Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ)**  
   - **Role**: Longtime champion of CPC funding. Introduced the **Pregnancy Assistance Act** (H.R. 1117 in 2019, reintroduced in 2021) to create a federal grant program specifically for CPCs, providing up to $25 million annually.  
   - **Quotes**:  
     > "Crisis pregnancy centers save lives by providing compassionate care, counseling, and resources to women facing unplanned pregnancies. This legislation ensures they have the support they need to continue their vital work."  
   - **Position**: Argues CPCs offer "life-affirming" services without abortion referrals, contrasting them with abortion providers.

2. **Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)**  
   - **Role**: Supported bills to redirect federal funds to CPCs. Co-sponsored the **Pregnancy Assistance Act** and advocated for allowing states to use Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) funds for CPCs.  
   - **Quotes**:  
     > "Women deserve access to accurate information and support when they are pregnant. Crisis pregnancy centers provide critical resources without pushing abortion."  
   - **Position**: Focuses on "empowering women" through CPC services, claiming they are misrepresented as "anti-women."

3. **Rep. Mike Bost (R-IL)**  
   - **Role**: Supported amendments to block grants to allow state funding for CPCs. Voted for the **No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act** (H.R. 7), which critics argue could indirectly benefit CPCs by defunding abortion providers.  
   - **Position**: Emphasizes CPCs as "safe spaces" for pregnant women.

### **Members of Congress Who Have Opposed CPC Funding**
These lawmakers argue **CPCs are deceptive, lack medical oversight, and should not receive public funds**. They are typically Democrats who highlight evidence of CPCs misleading patients about abortion, contraception, and health risks.

1. **Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA)**  
   - **Role**: Vocal opponent of CPC funding. Co-sponsored the **Protecting Women’s Health Act** (H.R. 102 in 2023), which would block federal funding for CPCs and ensure access to comprehensive reproductive care.  
   - **Quotes**:  
     > "Crisis pregnancy centers are not medical clinics. They spread misinformation, delay care, and endanger women’s health. Public funds should never support these deceptive operations."  
   - **Position**: Cites studies showing CPCs often mislead patients (e.g., claiming abortion causes breast cancer, refusing to provide contraception).

2. **Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL)**  
   - **Role**: Led efforts to block CPC funding in appropriations bills. Criticized the Trump administration’s Title X rule changes for indirectly benefiting CPCs (though CPCs were never eligible for Title X).  
   - **Quotes**:  
     > "These centers are not healthcare providers. They are ideological operations that exploit vulnerable women. Taxpayer dollars must fund evidence-based care, not propaganda."  
   - **Position**: Focuses on CPCs' lack of medical licensure and their role in creating barriers to abortion access.

3. **Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA)**  
   - **Role**: Opposed amendments to allow CSBG funds for CPCs. Argued CPCs "undermine women’s health" and divert resources from clinics providing full reproductive care.  
   - **Position**: Emphasizes that CPCs often withhold information about abortion and contraception, violating medical ethics.

### **Why This Debate Is Misunderstood**
- **CPCs are not federally funded**: Federal law (e.g., Title X) prohibits funding for CPCs. Any "funding" debates in Congress are about **proposed new programs**, not existing allocations.
- **State-level vs. federal**: Most funding for CPCs happens at the **state level** (e.g., Texas allocates $15 million/year to CPCs). Congress has limited direct authority here.
- **Misinformation risk**: CPCs often claim to be "medical clinics," but they are typically run by religious groups, staffed by non-medical personnel, and do not provide abortions, contraception, or evidence-based care. Studies (e.g., by the Guttmacher Institute) show they frequently mislead patients.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Supporters of CPC funding** (e.g., Chris Smith, Marsha Blackburn) push for **new federal programs** to subsidize CPCs as "pro-life alternatives," framing them as supportive of women.
- **Opponents** (e.g., Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky) argue CPCs are **unregulated, deceptive, and harmful**, and should not receive any public funds. They stress that federal dollars should go to licensed clinics providing comprehensive care.

For accurate information, rely on sources like the **Guttmacher Institute** or **ACLU**, which document CPC practices and funding debates. If you're researching a specific bill or state-level action, clarify whether it involves federal or state funding—most CPC funding occurs at the state level, not in Congress.
