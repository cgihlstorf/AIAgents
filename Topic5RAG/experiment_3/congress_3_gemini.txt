In January 2026, the U.S. House of Representatives saw a major debate over the Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act (H.R. 6945). The bill was designed to ensure that pregnancy resource centers (often called crisis pregnancy centers) remain eligible for federal funding through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.

The debate largely split along party lines, with high-profile members of Congress leading the arguments on both sides.

1. Voices in Support of Funding
Proponents argued that pregnancy centers provide essential, free-of-charge resources to mothers and families, filling a gap in maternal care.

Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-MN): As the lead sponsor of the bill, she argued that the centers offer a "safe environment" where women are "empowered and educated" on resources rather than being pressured into abortion.

Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ): A co-chair of the Pro-Life Caucus, Smith praised the "life-saving and life-enhancing services" of these centers. He accused the previous administration of "weaponizing the federal bureaucracy" to discriminate against them by proposing rules to block their access to TANF funds.

Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO): Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he emphasized that in his home state of Missouri, three out of every four dollars the state provides to these centers comes from TANF. He argued that blocking this funding would effectively close one of the few places women can receive care and support.

Rep. Claudia Tenney (R-NY): Argued that the centers provide vital medical care, parenting support, and essential supplies like diapers and formula, helping women "choose life and care for their children with dignity."

2. Voices Against Funding
Opponents argued that these centers are not medical facilities and use deceptive tactics to prevent women from accessing abortion care.

Rep. Julia Brownley (D-CA): Released a strong statement calling the legislation "cruel and immoral." She argued that it diverts scarce TANF resources—meant for food and housing for struggling families—to centers that she claimed use "deceptive and coercive tactics" to block reproductive health care.

Rep. Maxine Dexter (D-OR): Speaking on the House floor, Dr. Dexter (a medical doctor) emphasized that these centers are not medical facilities and often lack licensed professionals. She criticized the rejection of amendments that would have required these centers to provide "medically accurate information."

Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA): During House Rules Committee hearings, she warned that the bill would block necessary oversight of "anti-abortion centers" and allow them to continue operating without basic medical standards while receiving federal tax dollars.

Key Legislative Outcome
The House passed H.R. 6945 on January 21, 2026, with a vote of 215–209. The bill has since moved to the Senate, where it was referred to the Senate Finance Committee on January 26, 2026.
