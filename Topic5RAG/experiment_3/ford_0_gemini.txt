Adjusting the carburetor on a Ford Model T is a quintessential "old school" mechanical task. Unlike modern cars with fuel injection and computers, the Model T relies on a simple needle valve and your own ears to get the mixture right.

Most Model Ts use a Holley NH or a Kingston L4 carburetor. Here is how you dial it in.

1. The Initial "Cold Start" Setting
Before you even crank the engine, you need a baseline setting that guarantees it will actually fire up.

Locate the adjustment rod: This is the long rod that goes from the carburetor through the dash (firewall).

Close the valve: Turn the knob clockwise until it gently seats. Don't force it, or you’ll score the needle.

Open for starting: Turn the knob counter-clockwise (open) about 1.5 to 2 full turns. This provides a "rich" mixture, which is necessary for a cold start.

2. Warming Up
Start the car and let it run for a few minutes.

Move the spark lever (left side of steering column) down about halfway to advance the timing once it’s running.

Wait until the engine reaches operating temperature. You can't properly tune a cold Model T.

3. The "Lean Out" (The Fine Tuning)
Once the engine is warm, you want to find the "sweet spot" where the engine runs smoothly with the least amount of fuel.

Slowly turn the dash knob clockwise (right): This leans out the mixture.

Listen to the engine: Keep turning until the engine begins to stumble or "hunt."

Back it off: As soon as it stumbles, turn the knob back counter-clockwise (left) about 1/8th to 1/4 of a turn until the idle smooths out and sounds crisp.

The Goal: Usually, once warm, the car will run best at about 1 to 1.25 turns open from the closed position.
