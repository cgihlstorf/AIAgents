ted because that practice adds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross
violations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.

There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or infer emotions, particularly
as expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures and situations, and even within a single individual.
Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited

systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain 
natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of 
AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and 
education should be prohibited.

2.

Critical infrastructure: AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of
critical digital infrastructure, road traffic, or in the supply of water, gas, heating or electricity.

ng the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited 
generalisability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis 
of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the 
concerned persons.

Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited
generalisability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis
of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the
concerned persons.

The risks include:

1. Mass surveillance which can lead to violations of fundamental rights like privacy.
2. Limited reliability, specificity, and generalisability of these systems.
3. Potential discrimination against certain groups based on biometric data.
4. Intrusiveness to the rights and freedoms of concerned individuals.

This answer directly addresses the potential risks mentioned in the sources, focusing on the limitations and consequences of using AI systems designed to detect human emotions. It highlights how these systems might infringe upon privacy, discriminate unfairly, and pose threats to personal liberties. 

The provided context emphasizes the importance of considering cultural variations and individual differences when developing such systems, suggesting that relying solely on AI to infer emotions without proper consideration of these factors could result in flawed or biased outcomes. This underscores the need for careful design and validation processes to ensure that AI-based emotion detection systems operate ethically and justly. 

In summary, while AI has the potential to enhance our understanding of human behavior through emotion recognition, it also poses significant challenges that must be addressed to prevent misuse and protect individual rights. The risk assessment outlined here provides a comprehensive view of the issues involved, highlighting both the benefits and the dangers associated with this technology. 

To summarize, the risks of AI systems built to detect human emotions include:

- **Mass Surveillance:** Practices that add to feelings of mass surveillance can lead to violations of fundamental rights, including privacy.
- **Limited Reliability, Specificity, and Generalisability:** These systems often struggle due to varied expressions of emotions across different cultures and situations, leading to unreliable results.
- **Discrimination:** Such systems can lead to adverse treatment of specific groups based on biometric data, potentially violating rights and freedoms.
- **Intrusiveness:** They may intrude upon the rights and freedoms of concerned individuals by being overly intrusive or discriminatory. 

These points underscore the necessity for rigorous development, testing, and ethical considerations before deploying AI systems aimed at detecting human emotions. Ensuring fairness, accuracy, and respect for individual rights is crucial to mitigate these risks effectively. 

By addressing these critical aspects, we can harness the capabilities of AI for positive purposes while minimizing its potential harms. The emphasis on cultural sensitivity and individual variability in emotion detection highlights the complexity of this task and the importance of thorough evaluation throughout the development process. 

In conclusion, the risks of AI systems for detecting human emotions encompass various dimensions, from legal and ethical implications to practical limitations. By carefully navigating these challenges, we can leverage AI responsibly to improve our understanding of human behavior and interactions. This
