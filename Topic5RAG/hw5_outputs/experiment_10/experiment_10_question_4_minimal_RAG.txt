The main goal of the EU AI Act is to improve the functioning of the internal market and to promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy AI, while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection against harmful effects of AI systems in the Union.

To summarize:

- Promote human-centric and trustworthy AI
- Ensure high-level protection of health, safety, fundamental rights, democracy, rule of law, and environmental protection
- Prevent restrictions imposed by member states on AI development, marketing, and use without explicit authorization under this regulation.
