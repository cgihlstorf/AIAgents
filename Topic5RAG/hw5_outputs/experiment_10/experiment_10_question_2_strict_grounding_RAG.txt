be a sufficient reason to exclude compliance with the obligations under this Regulation. In any case, given that the 
release of general-purpose AI models under free and open-source licence does not necessarily reveal substantial 
information on the data set used for the training or fine-tuning of the model and on how compliance of copyright

contribute to research and innovation in the market and can provide significant growth opportunities for the Union
economy. General-purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences should be considered to ensure
high levels of transparency and openness if their parameters, including the weights, the information on the model
architecture, and the information on model usage are made publicly available.

onents. The fact of making AI components available through open
repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetisation.

(104) The providers of general-purpose AI models that are released under a free and open-source licence, and whose

parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage,
are made publicly available should be subject to exceptions as regards the transparency-related requirements
imposed on general-purpose AI models, unless

Developers of open-source AI models should make public the parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage. Additionally, they should consider contributing to research and innovation in the market and providing significant growth opportunities for the Union economy. However, these practices do not automatically exempt them from complying with the transparency-related requirements imposed on general-purpose AI models.
