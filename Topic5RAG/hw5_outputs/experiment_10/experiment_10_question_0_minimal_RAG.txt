and cultural diversity, while avoiding 
discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental 
well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as 
well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the 
individual, society and democracy.

social or economic 
situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme 
poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with 
the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is 
reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may 
be accumulated over time

way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the
individual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the
design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this
Regulation.

AI systems can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, and social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. 

This answer correctly identifies several benefits of AI systems, including their ability to improve prediction, optimize operations, and allocate resources effectively. It also highlights how AI can support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, particularly in areas like healthcare, agriculture, and education. Additionally, it mentions how AI can help protect vulnerable populations from exploitation, which aligns with the broader context provided about AI's potential to avoid discriminatory impacts and unfair biases. However, the answer does not explicitly mention "cultural diversity" as one of the areas where AI can bring benefits, so it could be expanded to include this point. Overall, the answer provides a comprehensive overview of how AI can contribute positively to various aspects of society. 

The correct answer based on the given sources would be:

AI systems can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, and social or economic situations that are likely to make certain individuals more vulnerable to exploitation, such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. This ensures that AI applications do not exacerbate existing inequalities but rather promote fairness and inclusivity. Furthermore, they can enhance sustainability and environmental protection through responsible design and usage practices. Lastly, AI can foster cultural understanding and appreciation by providing personalized experiences and insights relevant to diverse communities.
