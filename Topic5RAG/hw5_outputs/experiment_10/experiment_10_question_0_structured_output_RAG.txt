and cultural diversity, while avoiding 
discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental 
well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as 
well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the 
individual, society and democracy.

social or economic 
situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme 
poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with 
the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is 
reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may

way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the
individual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the
design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this
Regulation.

AI systems can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, and social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. These benefits include improved prediction, optimisation of operations and resource allocation, and personalisation of digital solutions available for individuals and organisations. Additionally, AI systems can be designed and used to monitor and assess the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. Therefore, AI systems can benefit society through various means, including but not limited to, providing competitive advantages, supporting socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, protecting vulnerable populations, and ensuring long-term societal impact assessments. 

AI systems can also contribute to enhancing sustainability and environmental friendliness, promoting inclusivity and fairness, and fostering innovation and growth. However, it's important to ensure that these benefits are achieved in an ethical and responsible manner, taking into account potential risks and unintended consequences. It is crucial to develop and implement appropriate safeguards and regulations to address concerns related to privacy, data security, bias, transparency, accountability, and governance. Furthermore, ongoing research and development efforts are necessary to continuously improve AI technologies and their applications, ensuring they remain aligned with societal values and priorities. Ultimately, the successful integration of AI into society requires a collaborative effort between policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and civil society organizations to harness its full potential while mitigating associated challenges and risks.
