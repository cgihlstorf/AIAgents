ted because that practice adds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross
violations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.

There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or infer emotions, particularly
as expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures and situations, and even within a single individual.
Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited

systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain 
natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on the market, the putting into service, or the use of 
AI systems intended to be used to detect the emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and 
education should be prohibited.

Critical infrastructure: AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of
critical digital infrastructure, road traffic, or in the supply of water, gas, heating or electricity.

ng the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited 
generalisability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis 
of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the 
concerned persons.

Among the key shortcomings of such systems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited
generalisability. Therefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons on the basis
of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the
concerned persons.

The risks associated with AI systems designed to detect human emotions include:

1. **Privacy Concerns**: These systems can lead to an increase in feelings of mass surveillance, which can infringe upon fundamental rights like privacy.

2. **Cultural Sensitivity Issues**: There is concern over how these systems might interpret expressions of emotions differently across various cultures and situations, potentially leading to unfair discrimination against certain groups.

3. **Reliability and Specificity Limitations**: AI systems face limitations in terms of reliability, specificity, and generalizability, which can result in inaccurate or biased assessments of emotions.

4. **Potential Discrimination**: Such systems have the potential to cause adverse effects on specific individuals or entire groups, violating their rights and freedoms.

5. **Biometric Data Use Risks**: If these systems rely on biometric data, they risk creating discriminatory outcomes based on this personal information.

In summary, while AI has immense potential in enhancing our understanding and interaction with emotions, it also poses significant challenges regarding ethical considerations, cultural sensitivity, technical accuracy, and potential misuse. Addressing these issues requires careful development, regulation, and oversight to ensure responsible deployment of such technologies.
