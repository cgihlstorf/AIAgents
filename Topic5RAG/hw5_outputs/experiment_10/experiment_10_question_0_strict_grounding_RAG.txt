and cultural diversity, while avoiding 
discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental 
well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as 
well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the 
individual, society and democracy.

situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme 
poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with 
the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is

way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the
individual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the
design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this
Regulation.

AI systems can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, and social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. These benefits include improved prediction, optimisation of operations and resource allocation, and personalisation of digital solutions available for individuals and organisations. Additionally, they can be developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner, benefiting all human beings while monitoring and assessing their long-term impacts on the individual, society, and democracy. Furthermore, AI systems can avoid discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Lastly, they can be designed and used in a way that avoids material distortion of behavior causing significant harm to individuals or groups, especially those at risk due to vulnerability factors like extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities.
