contribute to research and innovation in the market and can provide significant growth opportunities for the Union
economy. General-purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences should be considered to ensure
high levels of transparency and openness if their parameters, including the weights, the information on the model
architecture, and the information on model usage are made publicly available.

onents. The fact of making AI components available through open
repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetisation.

(104) The providers of general-purpose AI models that are released under a free and open-source licence, and whose

parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage,
are made publicly available should be subject to exceptions as regards the transparency-related requirements
imposed on general-purpose AI models, unless

Developers of open-source AI models are encouraged to make public the parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage. This practice contributes to ensuring high levels of transparency and openness when it comes to these models' parameters and functionalities. Additionally, they must comply with the transparency-related requirements imposed by the regulation, even though releasing general-purpose AI models under a free and open-source license might not reveal substantial information about the data sets used for training or fine-tuning the model and the methods used to ensure compliance with copyright law. However, the fact of making AI components available through open repositories should not be considered a form of monetization.
