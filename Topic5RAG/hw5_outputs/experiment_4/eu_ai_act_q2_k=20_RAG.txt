Question: What practices are developers of open-source AI that is not general-purpose AI encouraged to follow?

According to the context, developers of free and open-source tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models are encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the Union. This approach aims to facilitate greater transparency and openness regarding the parameters, weights, model architecture, and usage information of these non-general-purpose AI components. Additionally, the text mentions that providers and, as appropriate, deployers of all AI systems, high-risk or not, and AI models should also be encouraged to apply on a voluntary basis additional requirements related, for example, to the elements of the Union's Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. However, no specific practices are explicitly stated for developers of open-source AI that is not general-purpose AI within the given context.
