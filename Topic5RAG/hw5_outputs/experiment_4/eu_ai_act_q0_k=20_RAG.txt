Question: In what ways can AI systems benefit society?

AI systems can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, and social or economic situations that are likely to make persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Additionally, AI systems foster innovation and facilitate the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their being placed on the market or put into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the providers or prospective providers and the competent authority. Furthermore, AI systems can be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. However, if AI systems are used for determining whether certain benefits and services should be granted, denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, including whether beneficiaries are legitimately entitled to such benefits or services, those systems may have a significant impact on persons' livelihoods and may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection. Lastly, AI systems used to monitor the performance and behavior of persons with certain characteristics, such as gender, age, disability, race or ethnicity, or sexual orientation, may undermine their fundamental rights to data protection and privacy. These benefits and drawbacks highlight how AI systems can both positively and negatively influence various aspects of society.
