Question: What are the risks of AI systems built to detect human emotions?

The risks associated with AI systems designed to detect human emotions include the potential for mass surveillance, which can foster feelings of being watched and monitored, leading to increased anxiety and discomfort among users. Additionally, these systems may have limitations in their accuracy due to variations in cultural expressions of emotions, making them unreliable and potentially unfair when applied to specific individuals or groups. Furthermore, there is concern that such systems might inadvertently contribute to discrimination against certain natural persons or entire groups, thereby violating fundamental rights like the right to privacy. These issues highlight the need for careful regulation to ensure ethical and effective deployment of AI technology in sensitive areas such as employment and education. To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to establish clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms to prevent misuse and protect user rights.
