Question: In what ways can AI systems benefit society?

AI systems can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, and social or economic situations that are likely to make certain persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Additionally, they foster innovation and facilitate the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their being placed on the market or put into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the providers or prospective providers and the competent authority. However, it's important to note that AI systems can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative, and social control practices. Therefore, it's crucial to monitor and assess the long-term impacts on the individual, society, and democracy. Furthermore, the application of ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards should take into account the needs of diverse populations, especially those who might be at risk due to socio-economic conditions. Lastly, ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner is essential for promoting social and environmental well-being.
