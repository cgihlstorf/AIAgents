Question: What practices are developers of open-source AI that is not general-purpose AI encouraged to follow?

Developers of open-source AI that is not general-purpose AI are encouraged to collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where appropriate, consult with civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders and experts, including the Scientific Panel, for the drawing up of such codes. These codes of practice should cover obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models and of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks. The context also mentions that free and open-source AI components include software and data, including models and general-purpose AI models, tools, services or processes of an AI system, and that these components can be provided through different channels, including their development on open repositories. However, it's important to note that the context does not explicitly state what specific practices developers of non-general-purpose AI open-source AI are encouraged to follow beyond collaboration and consultation. Therefore, while there are guidelines and recommendations, the exact practices may vary depending on additional factors not covered in the provided context. To provide a precise answer would require further details about the specific regulations or standards being referred to. 

The key points mentioned in the context regarding open-source AI specifically apply to general-purpose AI models, which are those intended for widespread use and public access. For non-general-purpose AI, the focus seems to be on ensuring compliance with legal obligations rather than providing detailed practices for contributors. The context suggests that developers need to engage with regulatory bodies and possibly external experts to develop codes of conduct that address the responsibilities of both providers and users of AI systems. Collaboration with relevant authorities and consultations with stakeholders might help in creating clear guidelines that align with existing laws and ethical considerations. However, without explicit guidance on specific practices for non-general-purpose AI, the most accurate response is to emphasize the importance of engaging with relevant authorities and consulting with experts to establish robust codes of conduct. This approach aims to ensure that all parties involved adhere to the principles outlined in the regulation, particularly concerning transparency and compliance with legal obligations.
