Question: What practices are developers of open-source AI that is not general-purpose AI encouraged to follow?

Developers of open-source AI that is not general-purpose AI are encouraged to engage with the AI Office early on. This practice ensures that they can address potential issues related to compliance with the obligations under this Regulation before the open-source model release. The context suggests that engaging with the AI Office at an early stage helps mitigate difficulties in implementing necessary measures post-release. However, it's noted that simply adopting an open-source license does not automatically exempt them from complying with these regulations; additional steps must still be taken to ensure transparency and adherence to copyright law. Therefore, while there isn't explicit guidance on specific practices beyond engagement with the AI Office, the context implies that developers need to maintain vigilance throughout the development process to meet regulatory standards effectively.
