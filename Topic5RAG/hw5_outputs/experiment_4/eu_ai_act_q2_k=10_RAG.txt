Question: What practices are developers of open-source AI that is not general-purpose AI encouraged to follow?

Developers of open-source AI that is not general-purpose AI are encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the Union. This approach aims to facilitate the dissemination of essential details about the AI components, which is crucial for ensuring transparency and openness, particularly important for high-risk AI models. Additionally, the context mentions that providers of general-purpose AI models must make their parameters, including weights, model architecture information, and usage information, publicly available, but it's noted that they may still need to comply with certain transparency-related requirements, although these do not apply universally to all AI components. To summarize, while there isn't explicit mention of specific practices for non-general-purpose AI, the guidelines suggest adopting documented practices like model cards and data sheets to enhance information sharing and promote trustworthiness in AI systems.
