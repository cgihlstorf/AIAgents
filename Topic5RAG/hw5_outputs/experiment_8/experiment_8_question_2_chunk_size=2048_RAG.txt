onents. The fact of making AI components available through open
repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetisation.

(104) The providers of general-purpose AI models that are released under a free and open-source licence, and whose

parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage,
are made publicly available should be subject to exceptions as regards the transparency-related requirements
imposed on general-purpose AI models, unless they can be considered to present a systemic risk, in which case the
circumstance that the model is transparent and accompanied by an open-source license should not be considered to
be a sufficient reason to exclude compliance with the obligations under this Regulation. In any case, given that the
release of general-purpose AI models under free and open-source licence does not necessarily reveal substantial
information on the data set used for the training or fine-tuning of the model and on how compliance of copyright
law was thereby ensured, the exception provided for general-purpose AI models from compliance with the
transparency-related requirements should not concern the obligation to produce a summary about the content used
for model training and the obligation to put in place a policy to comply with Union copyright law, in particular to
identify and comply with the reservation of rights pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790 of the
European Parliament and of the Council (40).

mission should be empowered to amend those annexes by means of delegated acts in
light of evolving technological developments.

(102) Software and data, including models, released under a free and open-source licence that allows them to be openly

shared and where users can freely access, use, modify and redistribute them or modified versions thereof, can
contribute to research and innovation in the market and can provide significant growth opportunities for the Union
economy. General-purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences should be considered to ensure
high levels of transparency and openness if their parameters, including the weights, the information on the model
architecture, and the information on model usage are made publicly available. The licence should be considered to be
free and open-source also when it allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve software and data,
including models under the condition that the original provider of the model is credited, the identical or comparable
terms of distribution are respected.

(103) Free and open-source AI components covers the software and data, including models and general-purpose AI

models, tools, services or processes of an AI system. Free and open-source AI components can be provided through
different channels, including their development on open repositories. For the purposes of this Regulation, AI
components that are provided against a price or otherwise monetised, including through the provision of technical
support or other services, including through a software platform, related to the AI component, or the use of
personal data for reasons other than exclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the
software, with the exception of transactions between microenterprises, should not benefit from the exceptions
provided to free and open-source AI components. The fact of making AI components available through open
repositories should not, in itself, constitute a monetisation.

viders of general-purpose AI models are able to know if their model would 
meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of that notification, the provider should be able to 
demonstrate that, because of its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. That 
information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with 
systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially

important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source, given that, after 
the open-source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation 
may be more difficult to implement.
(113)
If the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general-purpose AI model meets the requirements to classify as 
a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, which previously had either not been known or of which the 
relevant provider has failed to notify the Commission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so. 
A system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of general-purpose 
AI models that should possibly be classified as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the 
monitoring activities of the AI Office.
(114)
The providers of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, in addition to the 
obligations provided for providers of general-purpose AI models, to obligations aimed at identifying and mitigating 
those risks and ensuring an adequate level of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as 
a standalone model or embedded in an AI system or a product.

Developers of open-source AI models are encouraged to make the parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage, publicly available. They should also allow users to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve software and data, including models, under the condition that the original provider of the model is credited and the identical or comparable terms of distribution are respected. Additionally, they should consider themselves free and open-source even if they do not explicitly state this in their licenses, as long as these conditions are met. This encourages transparency and openness while avoiding potential systemic risks associated with such models.
