tation for providers of general-purpose AI 
models and the transparency information for providers of general-purpose AI models. It is of particular importance 
that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and 
that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional 
Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (55). In particular, to ensure equal participation in the 
preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as 
Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups 
dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.

Given the rapid technological developments and the technical expertise required to effectively apply this Regulation, 
the Commission should evaluate and review this Regulation by 2 August 2029 and every four years thereafter and 
report to the European Parliament and the Council. In addition, taking into account the implications for the scope of 
this Regulation, the Commission should carry out an assessment of the need to amend the list of high-risk AI 
systems and the list of prohibited practices once a year. Moreover, by 2 August 2028 and every four years thereafter, 
the Commission should evaluate and report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the need to amend 
the list of high-risk areas headings in the annex to this Regulation, the AI systems within the scope of the 
transparency obligations, the effectiveness of the supervision and governance system and the progress on the 
development of standardisation deliverables on energy efficient development of general-purpose AI models, 
including the need for further measures or actions.

rules should be consistent 
with the Charter, non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments. They should 
also take into account the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital Decade and the 
Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG).

A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster the development, use 
and uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a high level of protection of public interests, such 
as health and safety and the protection of fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and 
environmental protection as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the 
placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be laid down, thus ensuring 
the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those systems to benefit from the principle of free 
movement of goods and services. Those rules should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, 
supportive of new innovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors creating AI 
systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the 
Union.

REGULATION (EU) 2024/1689 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 13 June 2024
laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence and amending Regulations (EC) No 300/2008, 
(EU) No 167/2013, (EU) No 168/2013, (EU) 2018/858, (EU) 2018/1139 and (EU) 2019/2144 and 
Directives 2014/90/EU, (EU) 2016/797 and (EU) 2020/1828 (Artificial Intelligence Act)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 16 and 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (3),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (4),
Whereas:
(1)
The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal 
framework in particular for the development, the placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of 
artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) in the Union, in accordance with Union values, to promote the uptake of 
human centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, 
fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the ‘Charter’), 
including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI 
systems in the Union, and to support innovation.

a wide array of economic, environmental and societal 
benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations 
and resource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of AI 
can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial 
outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, 
infrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy 
efficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate 
change mitigation and adaptation.
(5)
At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use, and level of technological 
development, AI may generate risks and cause harm to public interests and fundamental rights that are protected by 
Union law. Such harm might be material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic 
harm.
(6)
Given the major impact that AI can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital for AI and its regulatory 
framework to be developed in accordance with Union values as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European 
Union (TEU), the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and, pursuant to Article 6 TEU, the 
Charter. As a prerequisite, AI should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the 
ultimate aim of increasing human well-being.
(7)
In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and 
fundamental rights, common rules for high-risk AI systems should be established. Those rules should be consistent 
with the Charter, non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments.
