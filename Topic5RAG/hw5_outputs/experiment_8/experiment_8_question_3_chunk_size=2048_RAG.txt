protection by design and by default, as set out in 
Union data protection law, are applicable when personal data are processed. Measures taken by providers to ensure 
compliance with those principles may include not only anonymisation and encryption, but also the use of 
technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and allows training of AI systems without the 
transmission between parties or copying of the raw or structured data themselves, without prejudice to the 
requirements on data governance provided for in this Regulation.
(70)
In order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from the bias in AI systems, the 
providers should, exceptionally, to the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purpose of ensuring bias detection 
and correction in relation to the high-risk AI systems, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of natural persons and following the application of all applicable conditions laid down under this 
Regulation in addition to the conditions laid down in Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, be able to process also special categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest 
within the meaning of Article 9(2), point (g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(2), point (g) of Regulation 
(EU) 2018/1725.
(71)
Having comprehensible information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed and how they perform 
throughout their lifetime is essential to enable traceability of those systems, verify compliance with the requirements 
under this Regulation, as well as monitoring of their operations and post market monitoring. This requires keeping 
records and the availability of technical documentation, containing information which is necessary to assess the 
compliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements and facilitate post market monitoring.

to access and use high-quality data sets within the fields of activities of those actors which are related 
to this Regulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the facilitation of data sharing 
between businesses and with government in the public interest will be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable 
and non-discriminatory access to high-quality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For 
example, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and the 
training of AI algorithms on those data sets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy 
manner, and with an appropriate institutional governance. Relevant competent authorities, including sectoral ones, 
providing or supporting the access to data may also support the provision of high-quality data for the training, 
validation and testing of AI systems.
(69)
The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout the entire lifecycle of the AI 
system. In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default, as set out in 
Union data protection law, are applicable when personal data are processed.

uirements and obligations, including in respect of the transparency, 
technical documentation and record-keeping of AI systems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various 
operators involved in the AI value chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national law, in 
compliance with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems where such law falls outside 
the scope of this Regulation or pursues legitimate public interest objectives other than those pursued by this 
Regulation. For example, national labour law and law on the protection of minors, namely persons below the age of 
18, taking into account the UNCRC General Comment No 25 (2021) on children’s rights in relation to the digital 
environment, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems and pursue other legitimate public interest objectives, 
should not be affected by this Regulation.
(10)
The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by Regulations (EU) 
2016/679 (11) and (EU) 2018/1725 (12) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive (EU) 2016/680 
of the European Parliament and of the Council (13). Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (14) additionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, including by way of 
providing conditions for any storing of personal and non-personal data in, and access from, terminal equipment. 
Those Union legal acts provide the basis for sustainable and responsible data processing, including where data sets 
include a mix of personal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application of existing 
Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and powers of the independent supervisory 
authorities competent to monitor compliance with those instruments.

gn of 
coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is 
founded. According to the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are 
developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal autonomy, and that is 
functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety 
means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience 
against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and 
minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in 
accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of 
quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate 
traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as 
well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their 
rights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that 
includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding 
discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental 
well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as 
well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the 
individual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the 
design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this 
Regulation.

mation and documentation to providers of AI systems who intend to
integrate the general-purpose AI model into their AI systems. Without prejudice to the need to observe and protect
intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade secrets in accordance with Union and
national law, the information and documentation shall:
(i) enable providers of AI systems to have a good understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the
general-purpose AI model and to comply with their obligations pursuant to this Regulation; and
(ii) contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex XII;
(c) put in place a policy to comply with Union law on copyright and related rights, and in particular to identify and comply
with, including through state-of-the-art technologies, a reservation of rights expressed pursuant to Article 4(3) of
Directive (EU) 2019/790;
(d) draw up and make publicly available a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training of the
general-purpose AI model, according to a template provided by the AI Office.
