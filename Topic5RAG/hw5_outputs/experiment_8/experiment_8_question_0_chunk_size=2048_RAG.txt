y aware of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be 
deceived or are not able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain interfaces 
or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as they 
may materially distort their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise 
exploit the vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of 
Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), or a specific social or economic 
situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme 
poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with 
the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is 
reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may 
be accumulated over time and should therefore be prohibited. It may not be possible to assume that there is an

Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on the accessibility requirements for

re typically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position 
in relation to the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits and services 
should be granted, denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, including whether beneficiaries are 
legitimately entitled to such benefits or services, those systems may have a significant impact on persons’ livelihood 
and may infringe their fundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human dignity 
or an effective remedy and should therefore be classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, this Regulation should not 
hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in the public administration, which would stand to 
benefit from a wider use of compliant and safe AI systems, provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to 
legal and natural persons. In addition, AI systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural 
persons should be classified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons’ access to financial resources 
or essential services such as housing, electricity, and telecommunication services. AI systems used for those purposes 
may lead to discrimination between persons or groups and may perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, 
such as that based on racial or ethnic origins, gender, disabilities, age or sexual orientation, or may create new forms 
of discriminatory impacts. However, AI systems provided for by Union law for the purpose of detecting fraud in the 
offering of financial services and for prudential purposes to calculate credit institutions’ and insurance undertakings’ 
capital requirements should not be considered to be high-risk under this Regulation. Moreover, AI systems intended

a wide array of economic, environmental and societal 
benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social activities. By improving prediction, optimising operations 
and resource allocation, and personalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of AI 
can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial 
outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, 
infrastructure management, energy, transport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy 
efficiency, environmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and climate 
change mitigation and adaptation.

At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use, and level of technological 
development, AI may generate risks and cause harm to public interests and fundamental rights that are protected by 
Union law. Such harm might be material or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic 
harm.
(6)
Given the major impact that AI can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital for AI and its regulatory 
framework to be developed in accordance with Union values as enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European 
Union (TEU), the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and, pursuant to Article 6 TEU, the 
Charter. As a prerequisite, AI should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for people, with the 
ultimate aim of increasing human well-being.
(7)
In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards health, safety and 
fundamental rights, common rules for high-risk AI systems should be established. Those rules should be consistent 
with the Charter, non-discriminatory and in line with the Union’s international trade commitments.

an dignity and personal autonomy, and that is
functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and overseen by humans. Technical robustness and safety
means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience
against attempts to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and
minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in
accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of
quality and integrity. Transparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows appropriate
traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they communicate or interact with an AI system, as
well as duly informing deployers of the capabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their
rights. Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that
includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality and cultural diversity, while avoiding
discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental
well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as
well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the
individual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the
design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this
Regulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and standardisation organisations, are
encouraged to take into account, as appropriate, the ethical principles for the development of voluntary best
practices and standards.

s Regulation.

(165) The development of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems in accordance with the requirements of this

Regulation may lead to a larger uptake of ethical and trustworthy AI in the Union. Providers of AI systems that are
not high-risk should be encouraged to create codes of conduct, including related governance mechanisms, intended
to foster the voluntary application of some or all of the mandatory requirements applicable to high-risk AI systems,
adapted in light of the intended purpose of the systems and the lower risk involved and taking into account the
available technical solutions and industry best practices such as model and data cards. Providers and, as appropriate,
deployers of all AI systems, high-risk or not, and AI models should also be encouraged to apply on a voluntary basis
additional requirements related, for example, to the elements of the Union’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI,

environmental sustainability, AI literacy measures, inclusive and diverse design and development of AI systems,
including attention to vulnerable persons and accessibility to persons with disability, stakeholders’ participation with
the involvement, as appropriate, of relevant stakeholders such as business and civil society organisations, academia,
research organisations, trade unions and consumer protection organisations in the design and development of AI
systems, and diversity of the development teams, including gender balance. To ensure that the voluntary codes of
conduct are effective, they should be based on clear objectives and key performance indicators to measure the
achievement of those objectives. They should also be developed in an inclusive way, as appropriate, with the
involvement of relevant stakeholders such as business and civil society organisations, academia, research
organisations, trade unions and consumer protection organisation.

According to the given context, AI systems can bring numerous benefits to society:

1. **Economic Benefits**: AI can improve prediction, optimize operations, and allocate resources efficiently, leading to increased competitiveness and productivity for businesses.

2. **Sustainable Development**: AI can contribute to environmental monitoring, conservation of biodiversity, and mitigating climate change through better resource efficiency and sustainable practices.
