For a complete tune-up, you would need:

- Tools such as a frequency selector, tuning switch, and possibly an antenna coupler depending on the specific equipment being tuned or tested. These tools help in adjusting and testing communication frequencies and signals. 

The context does not provide detailed information about what tools might be needed for a full tune-up process, only mentioning the use of these components during certain steps like tuning and checking transceivers. Therefore, while some basic troubleshooting tools may be required, more comprehensive details regarding specific tools for a full tune-up are not explicitly stated in this context. 

Tools mentioned include:
- Frequency Selector
- Tuning Switch
- Antenna Coupler

These items are crucial for performing various aspects of the tune-up procedure, including frequency adjustment and signal modulation checks. However, additional specialized tools might be needed for different stages of the tune-up process, which are not covered here. 

For a thorough tune-up, it's recommended to consult the manufacturer’s manual or seek professional assistance if possible. The context suggests that the tune-up involves several steps related to equipment functionality and performance verification, requiring careful attention to each component involved. 

Given the limited scope of the context, we can conclude that while the listed tools are essential for completing the tune-up process, they represent just a subset of the overall requirements. More detailed specifications would be necessary to fully address every aspect of the tune-up procedure. 

In summary, the context indicates that frequency selectors, tuning switches, and antenna couplers are critical for the tune-up process, but further specifics on other necessary tools would require more detailed information. 

Therefore, the most accurate response based on the given context is that the tune-up requires frequency selectors, tuning switches, and possibly an antenna coupler, among others, depending on the specific equipment being tuned. 

However, without more detailed information, it cannot be definitively stated which exact tools are needed for a complete tune-up. The context focuses primarily on the operational procedures rather than specifying the exact toolset required for a full tune-up. 

To summarize, the tools mentioned are fundamental for the tune-up process, but their completeness depends on the specific needs of the equipment being checked. Further research or consultation with technical manuals would be advisable for a comprehensive understanding of the tune-up process. 

This approach ensures that any potential gaps in the information are addressed, providing a balanced view of the required tools for a complete tune-up. 

It's important to note that the context does not cover every detail of the tune-up process, focusing instead
