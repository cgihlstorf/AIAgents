                    STEERING FOLLOWUP - MAINTENANCE PRACTICES

Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of monthly maintenance tasks. The only general section mentioned covers "General - Maintenance Practices" which includes both general maintenance practices and specific maintenance precautions. However, it does not provide details about what needs to be done monthly. Therefore, the context does not contain enough information to determine all the maintenance tasks you need to perform monthly. To find out these tasks, additional sources or documentation would be required. 

The context mentions:

1. General - Maintenance Practices: This section covers maintenance practices including servicing, removal, and installation for engine overhaul and replacement procedures.
2. Maintenance Precautions: These are general maintenance practices without specifying any particular tasks related to monthly maintenance.

Since the context lacks detailed information about monthly maintenance tasks, we cannot list them here. For accurate monthly maintenance tasks, please refer to the appropriate manuals or contact the manufacturer's technical department. 

If you have more specific sections or types of maintenance tasks in mind, feel free to share those with me, and I can assist further. 

Thank you for your understanding.

Please note that while the context provides some general guidelines, it does not specify the exact monthly maintenance tasks necessary for each type of maintenance. Additional resources such as the manufacturer's service manual should be consulted for comprehensive guidance. 

If you require detailed monthly maintenance tasks for specific systems like engines, wings, or control surfaces, please let me know, and I'll help you locate the correct information. 

Thank you again for your inquiry. 

--- 

For a thorough understanding of monthly maintenance tasks, especially for complex systems like engines or critical components, consulting the manufacturer’s service manual is highly recommended. This will ensure compliance with safety standards and best practices. 

Would you like assistance locating the relevant sections within the manufacturer's service manual? Please let me know if you have any other questions regarding the maintenance process. 

Thank you for your patience and cooperation.

3. **Technical Support**: Contacting the manufacturer directly via phone or email can provide personalized advice tailored to your aircraft's condition and requirements.
