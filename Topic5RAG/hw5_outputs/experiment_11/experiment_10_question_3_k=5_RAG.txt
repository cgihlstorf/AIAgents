Safety Precautions 
A. 
Safety Precautions 
(1) 
Pull and tag applicable ·system circuit breaker. 
(2) 
Assure Battery and Stall Warning Switches are off prior to lowering 
any instrument panel. 
(3) 
Protect instrument face by suitable means. 
3. 
Removal/Installation · 
NOTE: The following instructions give typical removal and installation 
procedures for instruments. 
A. 
Remove Panel Component (See figure ·201) 
(1) 
Assure that Battery and Stall Warning Switches are OFF.

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of "safety warnings" as defined in the instruction set. However, the context does include several safety-related sections:

1. **Mach/Overspeed Warning**: This section discusses maintenance practices related to overspeed warning systems.
2. **Tools and Equipment**: It mentions general tools and equipment used during inspections/checks.
3. **Inspection/Check**: There's an inspection checklist item focusing on ensuring battery and stall warning switches are off before lowering any instrument panel.

These items collectively represent some aspects of safety procedures but do not encompass all safety warnings mentioned in the original instruction set. Therefore, the summary of safety warnings from the given context would be limited to these specific areas. 

To provide a more comprehensive summary, additional details about each section should be included. For instance, one might need to expand on how to pull and tag system circuit breakers, what constitutes protective measures when inspecting instrument faces, and detailed steps for removing and installing panel components. These expanded explanations would cover the full scope of safety warnings typically found in aviation manuals. 

Given the constraints of the context, it’s clear that while certain safety elements are addressed, they don’t constitute a complete list of all safety warnings present in the manual. To accurately summarize all safety warnings, further documentation or clarification would be necessary. 

In conclusion, the provided context highlights key safety practices within the manual but does not comprehensively cover all safety warnings. A fuller summary would require additional information beyond what is presented here.
