Question: Compare the procedures for adjusting the engine vs. adjusting the brakes.

Context: [Source: ATA_32.pdf, Relevance: 0.558]
Automatic adjustment of brakes
to compensate for brake wear is accomplished as follows.
As the brakes
wear, the return pins and tubes are pulled through grips by the pressure
plate movement.
This small movement between pin and grip is equal to the
combined wear of all braking surfaces.
Thus, when the brake return springs
return the pressure plate to the released position, the built-in clearance
1
between the pressure plate and discs remains at a preset constant.
Depressing the brake pedals and pulling the

The procedure for adjusting the brakes involves monitoring the wear on components like return pins and tubes, which are pulled through grips by the pressure plate movement. This allows for automatic adjustment of the brakes to maintain a preset clearances between the pressure plate and discs. The process includes depressions of the brake pedals and pulling the brake cables to ensure the clearance remains consistent during operation. In contrast, the procedure for adjusting the engine typically involves more detailed checks such as inspecting for wear, cracks, hydraulic leaks, and ensuring proper release. It also may include specific actions like setting the brake assembly evenly and performing other maintenance tasks related to the engine's condition. The context does not provide details about the exact steps involved in adjusting the engine but implies that it would involve different criteria compared to the brakes due to the nature of their functions and the systems they operate within.
