Question: Compare the procedures for adjusting the engine vs. adjusting the brakes.

Context: [Source: ATA_32.pdf, Relevance: 0.558]
Automatic adjustment of brakes
to compensate for brake wear is accomplished as follows.
As the brakes
wear, the return pins and tubes are pulled through grips by the pressure
plate movement.
This small movement between pin and grip is equal to the
combined wear of all braking surfaces.
Thus, when the brake return springs
return the pressure plate to the released position, the built-in clearance
1
between the pressure plate and discs remains at a preset constant.

The procedure for adjusting the brakes involves monitoring the clearance between the pressure plate and the discs, which should remain constant despite wear. This is achieved by ensuring that the return pins and tubes move with the pressure plate's movement but not too far, thus compensating for the combined wear of all braking surfaces. On the other hand, there is no specific mention of an engine adjustment process in the given context. Therefore, the primary difference lies in the maintenance aspect related to brake systems versus engines.
