Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of safety warnings or practices within the manuals listed. However, several sections do provide general guidelines and procedures related to safety:

1. **Mach/Overspeed Warning**: Describes how to maintain these systems, including checking battery and stall warning switches before lowering an instrument panel.

2. **Tools and Equipment**: Provides details on inspection/checking tools and equipment.

3. **Inspection/Check**: Mentions protecting instrument faces during inspections.

4. **Safety Precautions**: Includes safety precautions for removing and installing panels, ensuring battery and stall warning switches are off before lowering instrument panels, and securing units properly.

While these sections cover various aspects of safety, they don't specifically detail "safety warnings" as requested. Therefore, the answer cannot be directly summarized from the given context alone. 

To summarize, the manuals mentioned include detailed guidance on maintaining certain systems, inspecting tools and equipment, performing checks, and providing safety precautions but do not explicitly list safety warnings. For a comprehensive summary of safety warnings, one would need to refer to separate sources or manuals dedicated solely to safety protocols.
