For a complete tune-up, you would typically need a frequency selector, a tuning switch, and possibly other accessories depending on the specific equipment being tuned. However, without more details about the exact equipment mentioned in the context, it's difficult to provide an exhaustive list. Based on the given sources, the most common items needed include:

1. Frequency Selector
2. Tuning Switch
3. Antenna Coupler

These components are essential for tuning various frequencies and ensuring proper operation of the system. Additional tools might be required for specific tasks like tightening bolts or applying torque as per the instructions provided. 

For Sunair SCU55 HF Control Panel, the context mentions using fasteners such as 16-30A and 16-.29A, which could indicate additional hardware needs during installation. However, these are not directly related to tuning operations themselves. 

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention all necessary tools, the key components for tuning are likely to include a frequency selector, a tuning switch, and an antenna coupler. Further specifics would depend on the detailed specifications of the equipment involved.
