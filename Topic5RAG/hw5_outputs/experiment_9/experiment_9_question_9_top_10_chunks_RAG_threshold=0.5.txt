Based on the provided context, the main goal of the EU AI Act appears to be establishing harmonized rules for the development, testing, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence systems within the European Union. This includes setting up prohibitions on certain AI practices, imposing specific requirements for high-risk AI systems, and creating harmonized transparency rules for these systems. Additionally, the regulation aims to ensure the placement of general-purpose AI models on the market by specified deadlines and provides mechanisms for market monitoring, surveillance, governance, and enforcement. It also addresses the responsibility and competencies regarding AI systems that are built on general-purpose AI models. Lastly, the text mentions clarifying the roles and responsibilities between Union and national levels concerning AI systems, emphasizing informed deployment and awareness among users about both the opportunities and potential harms of AI technology. These points collectively outline the primary objectives outlined in the EU AI Act document.
