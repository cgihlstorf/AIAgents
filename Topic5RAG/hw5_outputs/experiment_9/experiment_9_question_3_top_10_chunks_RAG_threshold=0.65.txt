People have several data privacy rights with respect to AI, including:

1. The right to privacy and to protect personal data throughout the entire lifecycle of the AI system, as outlined in the context.

2. Protection of personal data from being processed in violation of the fundamental right to data protection and privacy, as mentioned in the text about the performance and behavior of individuals using AI systems.

3. The application of data minimization, data protection by design and by default principles derived from Union data protection laws, especially those concerning personal data processing in connection with the rights and obligations laid down in this Regulation. 

These rights aim to ensure that personal data are handled responsibly and securely, aligning with legal frameworks like GDPR and other relevant EU directives. They emphasize the importance of protecting privacy and ensuring that AI systems operate within ethical boundaries.
