The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout the entire lifecycle of the AI 
system. In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default, as set out in 
Union data protection law, are applicable when personal data are processed.

Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to and enjoyment of certain
essential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve
one’s standard of living.

example, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and the
training of AI algorithms on those data sets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy
manner, and with an appropriate institutional governance.

s to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and 
minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in 
accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of 
quality and integrity.

The context mentions several aspects related to AI data privacy rights:

1. **Privacy Preserving Processing**: It emphasizes the importance of ensuring privacy preservation during the processing of personal data, particularly in relation to AI systems. This includes using technology like anonymization and encryption to protect data from unauthorized access.

2. **Data Protection Principles**: The text highlights the application of Union data protection laws, specifically mentioning the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default. These principles guide how personal data should be handled within AI systems.

3. **Compliance and Governance**: There's discussion about measures providers can take to comply with these principles, such as using technology that ensures algorithms are trained without transmitting raw or structured data, thereby minimizing risks associated with data breaches or misuse.

4. **Transparency and Trustworthiness**: The context underscores the need for transparency and trustworthiness in handling personal data, especially concerning AI systems, emphasizing the importance of institutions providing oversight and governance mechanisms.

These points collectively highlight the key elements of AI data privacy rights outlined in the context, focusing on privacy preservation, adherence to legal frameworks, and responsible management practices. However, it does not provide detailed specifics regarding all aspects of AI data privacy rights covered in the full document.
