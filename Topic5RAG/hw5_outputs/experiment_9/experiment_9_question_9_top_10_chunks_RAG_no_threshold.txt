Based on the information provided in the context, the EU AI Act aims to establish harmonized rules on artificial intelligence within the European Union. It includes provisions related to the placement of AI systems, prohibitions of certain AI practices, specific requirements for high-risk AI systems, and harmonized transparency rules for certain AI systems. Additionally, the Act addresses market monitoring, market surveillance, governance, and enforcement aspects of AI systems. However, the text does not explicitly mention "main goals" but rather focuses on its key components and objectives. Therefore, while we know what the Act covers, the context does not specify the primary objectives of the EU AI Act. 

Relevant parts from the context:

"The EU Declaration of Conformity shall state that the high-risk AI system concerned meets the requirements set out in Section 2."

"General-purpose AI models that have been placed on the market before 2 August 2025 shall take the necessary steps in order to comply with the obligations laid down in this Regulation by 2 August 2027."
