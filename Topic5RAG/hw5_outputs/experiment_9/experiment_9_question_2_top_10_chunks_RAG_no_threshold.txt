release of general-purpose AI models under free and open-source licence does not necessarily reveal substantial 
information on the data set used for the training or fine-tuning of the model and on how compliance of copyright 
law was thereby ensured, the exception provided for general-purpose AI models from compliance with the

parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage,

imposed on general-purpose AI models, unless

encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to 
accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the 
Union.

According to the context, developers of free and open-source tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models are encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the Union. These practices aim to facilitate the dissemination of crucial details about the model's architecture, weights, and usage, ensuring high levels of transparency and openness.
