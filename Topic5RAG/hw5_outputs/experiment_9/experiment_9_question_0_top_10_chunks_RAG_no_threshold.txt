Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for
manipulative, exploitative and social control practices.

AI systems can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education and training, media, sports, culture, and social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Additionally, they can foster innovation and facilitate the development, training, testing and validation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their being placed on the market or put into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the providers or prospective providers and the competent authority. However, it's important to note that AI systems can also be misused and provide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Therefore, it's crucial to monitor and assess the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy. Furthermore, the application of ethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards should be taken into account. Lastly, the principle of ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the individual, society and democracy, should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. These principles should also serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this Regulation.
