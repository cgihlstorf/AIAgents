example, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and the
training of AI algorithms on those data sets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy

s to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and 
minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in 
accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of 
quality and integrity.

The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout the entire lifecycle of the AI system. This includes ensuring compliance with Union data protection laws, such as GDPR and ePrivacy, and implementing measures like anonymization, encryption, and technology that allows algorithms to be brought to data without transmission or copying of raw or structured data, all within an appropriate institutional governance framework. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of protecting against unauthorized alterations or unintended harm to the use or performance of AI systems.
