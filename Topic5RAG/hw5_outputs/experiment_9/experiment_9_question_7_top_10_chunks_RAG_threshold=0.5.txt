parameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model usage,
are made publicly available should be subject to exceptions as regards the transparency-related requirements

and open-source tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models should be 
encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to 
accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the 
Union.

According to the context, best practices for open-source AI developers include:

1. Developing AI components using open repositories (relevance: 0.555).
2. Ensuring that the terms of distribution are identical or comparable to those of the original provider (relevance: 0.629).

These practices align with the guidelines mentioned in the context regarding the respect of existing terms of distribution and the importance of ensuring compliance with regulations concerning free and open-source AI components. However, it's noted that these practices may become more challenging to implement after the release of general-purpose AI models as open-source, which highlights the need for ongoing collaboration and consultation with relevant stakeholders. Additionally, the context mentions encouraging developers to adopt widely accepted documentation practices like model cards and data sheets to facilitate information sharing within the AI value chain, promoting trustworthiness in AI systems.
