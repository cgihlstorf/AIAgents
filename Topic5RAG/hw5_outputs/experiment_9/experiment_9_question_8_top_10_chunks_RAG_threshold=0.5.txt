The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout the entire lifecycle of the AI 
system. In this regard, the principles of data minimisation and data protection by design and by default, as set out in 
Union data protection law, are applicable when personal data are processed.

Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to and enjoyment of certain
essential private and public services and benefits necessary for people to fully participate in society or to improve
one’s standard of living.

example, in health, the European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and the
training of AI algorithms on those data sets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, transparent and trustworthy
manner, and with an appropriate institutional governance.

s to alter the use or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and 
minimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are developed and used in 
accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while processing data that meets high standards in terms of 
quality and integrity.

The context emphasizes several key aspects related to AI data privacy rights:

1. **Privacy Preservation**: Data should be processed in a way that respects privacy, ensuring that personal data are protected throughout the lifecycle of the AI system.

2. **Data Minimization**: Personal data should be collected only as much as necessary, adhering to the principle of data minimization.

3. **Data Protection by Design and Default**: These principles apply to all data processing activities, including AI systems, emphasizing the importance of protecting personal data from inception.

4. **Compliance with Legal Frameworks**: The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded under Union data protection laws, specifically through Regulations (EU) 2016/679, (EU) 2018/1725, and Directive (EU) 2016/680.

5. **Access to High-Quality Data**: Access to high-quality data for training, validating, and testing AI systems should be ensured, particularly in sectors like healthcare where it's crucial for non-discriminatory access to health data.

These points collectively highlight the importance of maintaining privacy and security in AI systems, aligning with legal frameworks and ensuring fair access to essential services and benefits.
