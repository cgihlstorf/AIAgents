The main goals of the EU AI Act include improving the functioning of the internal market, promoting the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy AI, ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy, the rule of law, and environmental protection against harmful effects of AI systems in the Union, and preventing Member States from imposing restrictions on the development, marketing, and use of AI systems, unless explicitly authorized by this Regulation. Additionally, the Act aims to ensure the free movement, cross-border, of AI-based goods and services, thereby preventing Member States from imposing restrictions on the development, marketing, and use of AI systems, unless explicitly authorized by this Regulation. Furthermore, the Act includes provisions related to the development, placing on the market, putting into service, and use of AI systems in the Union, in accordance with Union values, to promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy AI while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter, including democracy, the rule of law, and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI systems in the Union. Lastly, the Act provides for measures to address prohibitions of certain AI practices, specific requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for operators of such systems, harmonized transparency rules for certain AI systems, harmonized rules for the placing on the market of general-purpose AI models, rules on market monitoring, market surveillance, governance, and enforcement, and measures tailored to the relevant national competent authorities upon request. These provisions collectively aim to enhance the ethical, legal, and regulatory framework for AI across the EU, fostering innovation while safeguarding public interest and protecting citizens' rights.
