ss all sectors of energy. That keeps 
it competitive. 
Our domestic deposits of oil and nat-
ural gas must be used judiciously. We 
are now the largest exporter of oil in 
the world. We will not be the last gen-
eration, however, to populate this 
country, and we cannot live in the 
past. We must live in the future. 
In the last century, and even this 
one, America often headed to war for 
oil 
interests. 
Our 
soldiers 
fought 
unending battles in godforsaken places 
anchored to dirty crude.

The manual recommends synthetic oil because it states "The engine oil system must be flushed whenever a type of oil is changed, whenever types of oil are mixed, or whenever an unapproved oil is used." This indicates that synthetic oils are preferred due to their superior performance characteristics compared to conventional oils, which can lead to better lubrication and reduced wear over time. Additionally, the mention of additional information on engine oil systems in the general electric maintenance manual suggests that there may be specific recommendations for synthetic oils within those guidelines as well. However, without more detailed information about the specific benefits of synthetic oils mentioned in the context, we cannot definitively state why they are recommended. Therefore, while synthetic oils are likely favored for their enhanced properties, the exact reason isn't explicitly stated in the given text. 

This answer relies on the assumption that the context implies that synthetic oils are chosen for their superior qualities but acknowledges that further details would be needed to confirm this recommendation with certainty.
