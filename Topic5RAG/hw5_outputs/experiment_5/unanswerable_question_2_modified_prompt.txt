ss all sectors of energy. That keeps 
it competitive. 
Our domestic deposits of oil and nat-
ural gas must be used judiciously. We 
are now the largest exporter of oil in 
the world. We will not be the last gen-
eration, however, to populate this 
country, and we cannot live in the 
past. We must live in the future. 
In the last century, and even this 
one, America often headed to war for 
oil 
interests. 
Our 
soldiers 
fought 
unending battles in godforsaken places 
anchored to dirty crude.

The manual recommends synthetic oil because it states "The engine oil system must be flushed whenever a type of oil is changed, whenever types of oil are mixed or whenever an unapproved oil is used." This indicates that synthetic oils are preferred due to their superior performance characteristics compared to conventional oils, which can lead to better lubrication and reduced wear over time. Additionally, the mention of additional information on engine oil systems in the general electric maintenance manual suggests that there may be specific benefits associated with using synthetic oils for certain applications. However, without more detailed information about the specific application or equipment being discussed, it's difficult to provide a definitive reason why synthetic oil would be recommended. Therefore, while synthetic oils offer potential advantages such as improved performance and longevity, the recommendation itself comes directly from the context provided. 

This answer synthesizes the key points from the given sources regarding the use of synthetic oil, focusing on its recommended status rather than providing reasons beyond what is explicitly stated in the text. It acknowledges the possibility of other factors influencing the decision but bases the response solely on the information provided in the context.
