Question: What practices are developers of open-source AI models encouraged to follow?

Context: [Source: EU_AI_Act.txt, Relevance: 0.688]
Developers of free
and open-source tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models should be
encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to
accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the
Union.

Developers of free and open-source tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models should be encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the Union. These practices include ensuring high levels of transparency and openness regarding the parameters, weights, architecture information, and usage details of these models. The context emphasizes the importance of making these documents accessible to promote research, innovation, and economic growth within the European Union.
