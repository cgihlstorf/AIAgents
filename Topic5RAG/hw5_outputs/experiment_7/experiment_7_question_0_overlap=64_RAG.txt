AI systems can provide significant benefits to society through various applications across different sectors. For example, they can enhance efficiency in healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment plans (Context 6/144). Additionally, AI can boost economic growth by automating processes and increasing productivity (Context 6/144). Furthermore, AI can facilitate better decision-making in areas like finance and transportation, leading to improved outcomes and reduced costs (Context 6/144). These advancements contribute to increased innovation and job creation, thereby enhancing societal well-being and fostering sustainable development (Context 6/144). However, it's important to ensure that these benefits are distributed equitably and that ethical considerations are taken into account to prevent misuse or harm (Context 6/144). The context emphasizes the need for AI literacy among providers, deployers, and affected persons to enable informed decision-making about AI systems, ensuring that they align with fundamental rights and values (Context 6/144).
