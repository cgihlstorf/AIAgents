and cultural diversity, while avoiding 
discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are prohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental 
well-being means that AI systems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as 
well as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the 
individual, society and democracy.

situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme 
poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. Such AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with 
the objective to or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that causes or is 
reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups of persons, including harms that may

way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-term impacts on the
individual, society and democracy. The application of those principles should be translated, when possible, in the
design and use of AI models. They should in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this
Regulation.

AI systems can provide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, such as improved prediction, optimised operations, resource allocation, personalisation of digital solutions, and development and use in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. Additionally, they can avoid discriminatory impacts and unfair biases, monitor and assess long-term impacts on individual, society, and democracy, and ensure benefits are shared equitably among all humans. These benefits include improvements in various sectors like healthcare, agriculture, food safety, education, media, sports, and culture. Furthermore, AI can help address vulnerabilities faced by certain populations, ensuring fairness and inclusivity.
