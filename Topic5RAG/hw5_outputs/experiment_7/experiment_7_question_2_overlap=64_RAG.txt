According to the context, developers of free and open-source tools, services, processes, or AI components other than general-purpose AI models are encouraged to implement widely adopted documentation practices such as model cards and data sheets as a way to accelerate information sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI systems in the economy. These practices aim to enhance transparency and openness regarding the parameters, weights, model architecture, and usage information of these components.
