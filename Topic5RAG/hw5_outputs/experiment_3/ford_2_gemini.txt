A slipping transmission band in a Model T is usually a sign of one of two things: either the band just needs a simple adjustment, or the lining is worn out and needs replacement.

Before you start tearing things apart, try the adjustment first. It’s a 10-minute job that often solves the problem.

1. Identify Which Band is Slipping
The Model T transmission has three bands. You need to know which one to tighten:

Reverse (Left): Usually the least used.

Slow Speed/Low (Center): The most common one to slip.

Brake (Right): If the car won't stop, this is the culprit.

2. The Adjustment Process
You will need a 11/16" wrench and a steady hand (don't drop anything into the transmission!).

Remove the Inspection Cover: This is the door on top of the transmission (held by 6 screws). Warning: Stuff a rag into the opening. If you drop a nut or washer into the transmission, you’ll be pulling the whole engine to get it out.

Locate the Adjuster Nut: For the Brake and Reverse bands, the adjusters are inside the transmission. For the Slow Speed (Low) band, the adjuster is a screw/nut on the outside (left side) of the transmission.

Tighten the Nut: * Turn the nut clockwise one full turn at a time.

The Goal: You want the pedal to engage firmly about 2 inches before it hits the floorboard.

Test the "Free Neutral": After tightening, ensure the car still rolls freely when the hand lever is upright. If it drags, you’ve gone too tight.

3. When Adjustment Isn't Enough
If you tighten the band and it still slips (or if the pedal feels "mushy"), the lining is likely glazed or worn down to the rivets.

Glazed Bands: If you've been "slipping the clutch" too much, the surface gets hard and shiny like glass. Sometimes you can "rough them up" with a hacksaw blade through the inspection door, but this is a temporary fix.

Worn Linings: If they are worn out, you'll need to replace them with either Cotton, Scandinavia, or Kevlar linings.

Critical Warning: Never let a band slip for long. The friction generates intense heat which can crack the cast-iron transmission drums, turning a $20 band job into a $1,000 engine overhaul.
