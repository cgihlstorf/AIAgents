The Model T oil debate is legendary among "T-heads," but the most important thing to remember is that the Model T uses a splash lubrication system. There is no oil pump; the flywheel flings oil into a funnel that feeds the front of the engine, and the transmission bands are literally bathed in the same oil as the engine.

Because the oil also lubricates the transmission bands, your choice affects both engine wear and how well your car "shifts."

1. The Modern Gold Standard
Most Model T owners today use a high-quality 10W-30 or 5W-30 detergent oil.

Why 5W-30 or 10W-30? These multi-viscosity oils are thin enough to flow into the small oil lines and bushings when the engine is cold, but they provide enough protection when hot.

Detergent vs. Non-Detergent: * Detergent Oil: Best for engines that have been recently rebuilt or cleaned. It keeps contaminants in suspension so they can be drained out.

Non-Detergent Oil: Only recommended if your engine hasn't been opened in 40 years and is full of thick "sludge." Detergent oil in a filthy engine can break that sludge loose and clog your oil lines.

2. The Case for 15W-40 (Diesel Oil)
Many enthusiasts swear by Shell Rotella T4 (15W-40).

The Benefit: It contains higher levels of ZDDP (Zinc), which provides extra protection for flat-tappet lifters and cams.

The Trade-off: It is thicker. In cold weather, a thick oil can make the car very difficult to hand-crank because the transmission bands will "drag" in the heavy oil.

3. Capacity and Maintenance
Capacity: Exactly 4 Quarts (one gallon).

The "Check": There is no dipstick. You must open the two petcocks on the back of the engine.

If oil flows from the top petcock, you have plenty.

If it only flows from the bottom one, add oil immediately.

Interval: Change it every 500 miles. Since there is no oil filter, the only way to get dirt out of the engine is to change the oil frequently.

The "Free Neutral" Test: If you find that your car tries to creep forward or is incredibly hard to crank when cold, your oil is likely too thick. Switching from a straight 30-weight to a 5W-30 often solves this.
