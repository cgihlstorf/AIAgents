The Main Street Parity Act (H.R. 5763) is bipartisan legislation designed to make it easier and cheaper for certain small businesses to get loans for buying or expanding property.

Specifically, the bill targets the SBA 504 loan program, which provides long-term, fixed-rate financing for major fixed assets like land and buildings.

The Problem It Solves
Under previous rules established in 1996, businesses categorized as "special-purpose properties" were hit with a penalty. Because these buildings were considered harder to resell (e.g., a bowling alley is harder to turn into a retail store than a standard warehouse), the Small Business Administration (SBA) required owners to provide an additional 5% in equity up front.

While a standard business might only need a 10% down payment, these "special-purpose" businesses were forced to put down 15%.

Key Provisions of the Act
Standardizing Equity: The bill eliminates that extra 5% penalty, lowering the equity requirement to 10% for all industries.

Leveling the Playing Field: It treats "special-purpose" properties the same as standard commercial properties, arguing that modern construction and rehabilitation technology make these buildings much more adaptable than they were 30 years ago.

Broad Industry Impact: This change specifically benefits businesses like:

Bowling alleys and recreation centers

Car washes and marinas

Nursing homes and hospitals

Funeral homes

Dairy farms

Legislative Status (As of early 2026)
The bill was introduced by Congressman Roger Williams (R-TX) and Congresswoman Lateefah Simon (D-CA). It passed the House of Representatives with overwhelming bipartisan support (383–8) on January 20, 2026, and was referred to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship on January 26, 2026.
