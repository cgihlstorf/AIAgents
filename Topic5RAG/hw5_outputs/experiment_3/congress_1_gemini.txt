There is no public record of a specific "mistake" made by Elise Stefanik in Congress on January 23, 2026.

However, her status during that time was a subject of significant political discussion due to several major developments in the months leading up to January 2026:

Ambassadorship Withdrawal: In early 2025, Stefanik was nominated by President Trump to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. However, in March 2025, the nomination was withdrawn because the Republican majority in the House was too slim to risk losing her seat.

Gubernatorial Bid: In November 2025, Stefanik announced she would run for Governor of New York in the 2026 election.

Exit from Politics: Shortly after starting her campaign, on December 19, 2025, Stefanik made the surprise announcement that she was dropping out of the governor's race and would not seek re-election to her Congressional seat in 2026, citing a desire to focus on her family.

By January 23, 2026, Stefanik was serving out her final term in the House of Representatives. While she remained a vocal member of the House Republican leadership, there were no widely reported gaffes or procedural errors linked to that specific date.

Is it possible you are thinking of a different date, or perhaps her earlier public disagreements with Speaker Mike Johnson regarding defense bill provisions in December 2025?
