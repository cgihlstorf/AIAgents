Question: What mistake did Elise Stefanik make in Congress on January 23, 2026?

According to the context, Elise Stefanik made a mistake by trying to overturn our democracy and ignoring repeated lawful orders from Capitol Police. Specifically, it mentions that she "pushed to the front of the crowd" and "helped to smash a window into the Speaker’s Lobby and attempted to force her way through a barricaded door while she was armed." The context also notes that she was "armed," indicating that she had some form of weapon during these actions. This suggests that Stefanik engaged in unauthorized and potentially unlawful behavior within the Capitol building. However, without more specific details about the exact nature of her actions or any official investigation findings, we cannot determine if she committed an overt act of violence or disorderly conduct. The text does not provide sufficient information to conclude definitively that she made a significant mistake related to her role as a member of Congress. Therefore, based solely on the given context, we cannot accurately state which specific mistake she made regarding her duties as a representative. 

It's important to note that such actions could be considered misconduct or even illegal under certain circumstances, but the context does not offer enough detail to make a definitive judgment. Further investigation would be necessary to assess the full implications of her actions.
