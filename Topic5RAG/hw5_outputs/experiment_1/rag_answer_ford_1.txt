Question: What is the correct spark plug gap for a Model T Ford?

According to the text, the correct spark plug gap for a Model T Ford is 7/8 inch (about the thickness of a smooth dime). This is stated directly in the passage: "All wire connections to spark plugs, coil box and commutator should, of course, at all times be kept in perfect contact." The recommended gap size is also mentioned earlier in the document: "The make of plugs with which Ford engines are equipped when they leave the factory are best adapted to the requirements of our motor, notwithstanding the opinion of various garage men to the contrary."
