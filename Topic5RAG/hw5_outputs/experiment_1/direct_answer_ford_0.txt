Question: How do I adjust the carburetor on a Model T?

The carburetor adjustment is done by turning the float bowl screw. This screw moves the float up or down, which in turn changes the amount of fuel that gets into the engine. To make sure you get the right amount of fuel, you need to know how much fuel your car needs. You can find out how much fuel your car needs by checking the owner's manual for information about the correct fuel level. If you don't have an owner's manual, you can usually find it online. Once you know how much fuel your car needs, you can use the float bowl screw to adjust the carburetor so that it provides the right amount of fuel.
