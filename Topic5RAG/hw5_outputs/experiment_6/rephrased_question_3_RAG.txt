r, turning the engine over with the starting crank about one-
quarter turn at a time until all of the magnets have been tested. 
With the magnet clamps positioned directly between the magneto 
coil cores, a reading of 45 units or better should register on the dial 
when magnets are checked in the car. When magnets are removed 
from the flywheel and checked individually a reading of 35 units or 
better should be obtained).

You need to perform an engine motoring check after 14 days or more of storage, when testing for the first time since installation, or if the lubrication and scavenging pumps have been replaced recently. The specific instructions also mention checking the engine's operation before storage and priming it if necessary under certain conditions. To ensure accurate readings during the operational check, you must prime the lubrication and scavenging pump according to the General Electric CJ610 Maintenance Manual SEI-186. Additionally, quick throttle movements can invalidate the test results. Based on these points, the most critical times for performing an engine check are after extended periods of storage, upon initial testing, and whenever there's a change in maintenance procedures involving the lubrication system.
