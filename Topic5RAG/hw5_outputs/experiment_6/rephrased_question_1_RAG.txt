Based on the information provided in the context, you should service the engine at least twice a month, specifically:

1. Drain and refill the radiator frequently, especially when the car is new.
2. Inspect the battery every two weeks and add fresh distilled water if necessary.
3. Tighten all bolts and nuts properly.
4. Take advantage of the thirty-day free inspection and adjustment service, suggesting driving the car into the service station every ten days during this period. Additionally, it's recommended to change the oil every 500 miles. 

The context also mentions checking the battery, tightening bolts, and draining and refilling the radiator "as soon as possible after need for them" is noticed. However, these actions do not specify how often they should be performed but rather when they should be done upon noticing any issues. The most frequent action mentioned regarding servicing the engine is changing the oil every 500 miles. Therefore, servicing the engine at least twice a month seems to be the general guideline provided. To ensure optimal performance and longevity, regular maintenance checks and timely replacements of worn-out components are advised.
