Based on the information provided in the context, the service recommendations include:

- Draining and refilling the radiator frequently, especially when the car is new.
- Inspecting the battery every two weeks and adding fresh distilled water.
- Tightening all bolts and nuts properly.
- Taking advantage of the thirty-day free inspection and adjustment service.
- Driving the car into the service station every ten days during this period.

The specific recommendation for servicing the engine involves draining and refilling the radiator, which occurs "especially while your car is new." This indicates that the frequency of these services depends on the condition of the vehicle at the time they are needed, but it suggests that regular maintenance practices such as checking the battery, tightening bolts, and taking advantage of the free inspection service are recommended more frequently. However, without additional details about the specific needs of the vehicle, it's difficult to provide an exact frequency. The context does not specify a fixed schedule beyond mentioning the importance of these tasks. 

Therefore, based on the given information, the most accurate answer is that these services should be performed "as soon as possible after need for them" is noticed, which implies a periodicity related to the vehicle's condition rather than a set schedule. To get a precise schedule, one would need to consult the manufacturer's guidelines or seek advice from a professional mechanic.
