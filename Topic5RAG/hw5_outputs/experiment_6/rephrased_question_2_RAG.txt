                                  with these inspection intervals. (Refer to Chapter
                                  12.)

The context mentions "Recommended inspection intervals" but does not specify any particular interval for engines. It states that inspection intervals are measured from the last inspection or return-to-service date and includes various types of checks such as Unscheduled Maintenance Checks, Scheduled Servicing, Replacement Items, Overhaul Items, and other inspections corresponding to the intervals specified here. However, it does not provide specific details about engine maintenance intervals. Therefore, the context does not give clear information about engine maintenance intervals. 

The text focuses more on general inspection practices rather than detailed specifications for engine maintenance intervals. To get accurate information about engine maintenance intervals, one would need additional sources or documentation specifically related to engine maintenance procedures.
