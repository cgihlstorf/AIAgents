TEST 11: Tools combined
============================================================
User: What is the sine of the weather in San Francisco times the number of l in lullaby plus the ratio of consonants to vowels in computer science?

--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM wants to call 1 tool(s)
  Tool: get_weather
  Args: {'location': 'San Francisco'}

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM wants to call 2 tool(s)
  Tool: num_letters
  Args: {'letter': 'l', 'phrase': 'lullaby'}
  Tool: consonant_vowel_ratio
  Args: {'phrase': 'computer science'}

--- Iteration 3 ---
LLM wants to call 1 tool(s)
  Tool: calculator
  Args: {'expr': 'sin(72) * 3 + 1.5'}

--- Iteration 4 ---
Assistant: 

The final result is approximately **2.2615**. 

Here's the breakdown:
- Weather in San Francisco: 72°F → used as 72 for calculation
- Number of 'l' in "lullaby": 3
- Consonant-vowel ratio in "computer science": 1.5
- Calculation: sin(72 radians) × 3 + 1.5 ≈ **2.2615**
