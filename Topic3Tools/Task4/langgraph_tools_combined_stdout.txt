TEST 11: Tools combined
============================================================
User: What is the sine of the weather in San Francisco times the number of l in lullaby plus the ratio of consonants to vowels in computer science?

--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM wants to call 3 tool(s)
  Tool: get_weather
  Args: {'location': 'San Francisco'}
  Tool: num_letters
  Args: {'letter': 'l', 'phrase': 'lullaby'}
  Tool: consonant_vowel_ratio
  Args: {'phrase': 'computer science'}

--- Iteration 2 ---
Assistant: 

The sine of 72 degrees is approximately 0.9511. Multiplying this by the number of 'l's in "lullaby" (3) gives 2.8533. Adding the consonant-vowel ratio of "computer science" (1.5) results in approximately **4.35**. 

Final answer: 4.35
