## Task 1

The real times taken by each process are as follows:

1. Original - sequential: 63.22s
2. Original - parallel: 82.75s 
3. Ollama - sequential: 2183s
4. Ollama - parallel: 2862s

Running Ollama took far more time than running the original models from HuggingFace. For both the HuggingFace and Ollama models, running the two programs sequentially took less time than running the two programs in parallel.
