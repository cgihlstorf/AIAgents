  Args: {'expr': '8 + 2'}
  Result: 10

--- Iteration 2 ---
Assistant: 

The result of $8 + 2$ is **10**.


============================================================
TEST 5: Calculator
============================================================
User: What is (5 ** 2) * 10 / 4?

--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM wants to call 1 tool(s)
  Tool: calculator
  Args: {'expr': '(5 ** 2) * 10 / 4'}

TEST 6: Weather and Calculator
============================================================
User: What is the temperature in New York divided by 11?

--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM wants to call 1 tool(s)
  Tool: get_weather
  Args: {'location': 'New York'}
  Result: Cloudy, 55Â°F

--- Iteration 2 ---
LLM wants to call 1 tool(s)
  Tool: calculator
  Args: {'expr': '55 / 11'}

============================================================
TEST 7: Calculator
============================================================
User: What is sin(5) + cos(0)?

--- Iteration 1 ---
LLM wants to call 1 tool(s)
  Tool: calculator
  Args: {'expr': 'sin(5) + cos(0)'}
  Result: 0.041075725336861546

--- Iteration 2 ---
Assistant: 

The result of $\sin(5) + \cos(0)$ is approximately **0.0411**. 

- $\cos(0) = 1$ (since cosine of 0 radians is always 1).
- $\sin(5)$ (where 5 is in radians) evaluates to approximately $-0.9589$.
- Adding them together: $-0.9589 + 1 = 0.0411$.
