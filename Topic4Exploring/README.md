## Task 3
1. What features of Python does ToolNode use to dispatch tools in parallel?  What kinds of tools would most benefit from parallel dispatch?

2. How do the two programs handle special inputs such as "verbose" and "exit"?

3. Compare the graph diagrams of the two programs.  How do they differ if at all?

4. What is an example of a case where the structure imposed by the LangChain react agent is too restrictive and you'd want to pursue the toolnode approach?
