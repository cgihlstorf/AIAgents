### Combined Summary of Information

**From Wikipedia:**  
Scrambled eggs are a culinary dish made by stirring or whisking eggs (typically chicken), then heating them until the proteins coagulate into soft curds. The earliest documented recipe appears in a 14th-century Italian cookbook. Preparation methods vary:  
- **Basic ingredients**: Eggs, salt, pepper, and optional additions like butter, milk, water, cream, cheese, or herbs.  
- **Two main approaches**:  
  1. *Whisking first*: Beat eggs thoroughly before cooking (Elizabeth David’s view for a smoother texture).  
  2. *Direct pan method*: Crack eggs directly into a hot pan and stir as they cook (Dorothy Hartley’s preference for visible egg particles).  
- **French style**: Cooked gently over low heat with constant stirring to achieve creamy, custard-like curds. A traditional double boiler method (taking up to 40 minutes) prevents browning but is less common today.  
- **British style**: Stirred thoroughly for a fine, soft texture. Variations include "Scotch woodcock" (served on toast with Gentleman’s Relish).  
- **Key tip**: Remove eggs slightly undercooked, as they continue to set after heat is removed. Overcooking causes syneresis (liquid separation) or rubberiness.  

**From DuckDuckGo (DDG) Results:**  
Multiple recipe sources emphasize practical, modern techniques for fluffy, restaurant-style scrambled eggs:  
- **Standard steps**: Whisk 3 large eggs with a pinch of salt, black pepper, and 3 tablespoons of whole milk until light and foamy. Cook in a buttered non-stick pan over **low heat**, stirring constantly with a spatula.  
- **Critical tips**:  
  - Avoid high heat to prevent rubbery eggs.  
  - Add cheese, herbs, or ham *after* cooking to preserve texture.  
  - Remove eggs just before fully set (they will finish cooking from residual heat).  
- **Common secrets**: Using milk or water for fluffiness, preheating the pan properly, and gentle stirring for even coagulation. Some sources highlight a "three-key-secrets" approach for luxury texture in under 10 minutes.

### Comparison Report  

| **Aspect**               | **Wikipedia**                                                                 | **DuckDuckGo (DDG)**                                                                 |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Core Methodology**     | Describes historical and regional variations (French vs. British styles), including traditional double boiler techniques. Mentions "two schools" of preparation (whisking first vs. direct pan cooking). | Focuses on modern skillet techniques with specific measurements (e.g., 3 eggs, 3 tbsp milk) and emphasizes low-heat, constant stirring. No mention of double boilers. |  
| **Ingredients**          | Notes milk/cream as optional; highlights regional variations (e.g., crème fraîche in French style). | Explicitly recommends milk for fluffiness, with precise quantities (e.g., 3 tbsp whole milk). |  
| **Cooking Technique**    | Discusses French-style creamy curds and British-style fine texture. Warns about overcooking but does not detail pan types. | Stresses non-stick pans, low heat, and constant stirring. Repeatedly advises removing eggs slightly undercooked to avoid rubberiness. |  
| **Practical Guidance**   | General overview of techniques without step-by-step instructions or common pitfalls. | Provides actionable tips: "avoid high heat," "add cheese after cooking," and "whisk until foamy." Multiple sources cite "restaurant-style" tricks for fluffy results. |  
| **Relevance to Users**   | Best for understanding cultural context and historical methods. Less useful for quick home cooking. | Ideal for immediate use: clear, concise steps tailored to home kitchens with measurable results. |  

**Key Takeaway**:  
Wikipedia offers a scholarly perspective on scrambled eggs’ history and global variations, while DDG delivers concise, actionable recipes optimized for home cooks. Both agree on critical principles (low heat, gentle stirring, avoiding overcooking), but DDG’s results prioritize practicality and modern preferences (e.g., milk for fluffiness), whereas Wikipedia contextualizes these techniques within broader culinary traditions. For beginners, DDG’s step-by-step guidance is more immediately helpful; for culinary enthusiasts, Wikipedia’s depth provides valuable insight into regional nuances.
