### Wikipedia Summary
The Wikipedia entry for "Scrambled eggs" provides a comprehensive overview of the dish as a culinary technique, not a specific recipe. Key points include:
- **Definition**: Scrambled eggs involve stirring or whisking egg whites and yolks (often with additives like salt, pepper, butter, milk, or cream), then heating to coagulate proteins into soft curds.
- **History**: Earliest documented recipe dates to a 14th-century Italian cookbook.
- **Preparation Methods**:
  - *Skillet method*: Eggs cooked in a hot pan with butter/oil over gentle heat, stirred continuously for small, soft curds. French-style emphasizes creamy, custard-like texture.
  - *Double boiler*: A traditional method requiring 40 minutes to prevent browning and achieve aerated, creamy results.
  - *Microwave/sous-vide*: Modern alternatives for consistent texture.
- **Variations**: 
  - British style: Thorough stirring for fine texture; "buttered eggs" (extra butter stirred in).
  - French style: Over 100 variants, often with additions like truffles or asparagus.
- **Technical Notes**: Eggs should be slightly undercooked when removed (residual heat finishes cooking). Overcooking causes syneresis (liquid separation).

### DuckDuckGo (DDG) Summary
DDG search results focus on practical, step-by-step recipes from cooking sources, emphasizing actionable tips for home cooks:
- **Key Tips**:
  - Use **low and slow heat** to avoid rubbery eggs and achieve fluffy, creamy texture.
  - Add **butter or oil** to the pan before eggs to prevent sticking.
  - Common ingredients: eggs, salt, pepper, butter (some recipes highlight "four ingredients" as sufficient).
  - **Stirring technique**: Constant stirring for even cooking; some methods suggest folding in cheese or herbs at the end.
  - **Avoiding mistakes**: Overcooking (leads to dryness), high heat (causes browning), or adding wet ingredients too early.
- **Specific Techniques**:
  - Restaurant-style methods for professional results.
  - Martha Stewart’s approach emphasizes simplicity and avoiding common pitfalls.
  - "Foolproof" methods for controlling doneness (e.g., stopping just before full set).

### Comparison Report
- **Similarities**: Both sources agree on core principles—gentle heat, stirring, and avoiding overcooking. Butter/oil is universally recommended for texture and non-stick properties.
- **Differences**:
  - **Depth vs. Practicality**: Wikipedia offers historical context, technical variations (e.g., double boiler), and cultural nuances (e.g., Scotch woodcock). DDG focuses solely on modern, home-friendly steps with immediate, actionable advice.
  - **Audience**: Wikipedia serves as a reference for understanding the dish broadly; DDG targets cooks seeking quick, reliable recipes (e.g., "4-ingredient" or "10-minute" guides).
  - **Detail Level**: Wikipedia discusses debates (e.g., beating eggs first vs. cracking directly into the pan), while DDG snippets prioritize clear, step-by-step instructions without theoretical tangents.
- **Key Takeaway**: For *understanding the science and history* of scrambled eggs, Wikipedia is ideal. For *making them today*, DDG results provide concise, tested methods tailored to home kitchens. Neither contradicts the other—they complement by addressing different needs: academic context vs. hands-on execution.
