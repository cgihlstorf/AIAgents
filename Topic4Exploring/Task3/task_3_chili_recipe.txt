### Summary from Wikipedia

Wikipedia provides detailed historical and regional context for chili-related dishes:

1. **Chili con carne**:  
   - A Mexican-origin spicy stew made with chili peppers, meat (typically beef), tomatoes, and often beans.  
   - Historical roots trace to Aztec-era stews seasoned with chili peppers; Spanish influence introduced beef.  
   - Disputes exist among enthusiasts: some insist "chili" should exclude beans and tomatoes, while others include them.  
   - Used as a side dish, garnish, or ingredient in soups/salsas.  

2. **Cincinnati-style chili (Gold Star & Skyline)**:  
   - *Not* traditional chili con carne; it’s a sweet-savory sauce served over spaghetti or hot dogs (e.g., "cheese coneys" or "3-ways").  
   - Gold Star (founded 1965 by Jordanian immigrants) and Skyline (founded 1949 by Greek immigrant Nicholas Lambrinides) use unique spice blends (e.g., cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cumin).  
   - Skyline’s recipe is a closely guarded family secret, while Gold Star produces ~20,000 lbs of chili daily.  
   - Both chains are deeply tied to Cincinnati culture and sponsor local sports teams.  

### Summary from DuckDuckGo

DuckDuckGo’s results reflect current recipe trends and home-cooking searches:  
- Mentions a "Homemade Chili recipe" described as versatile for weeknight meals or gatherings, with ratings and reviews from home cooks.  
- Lists specific recipe variations:  
  - **Crockpot chili** (slow-cooked, convenient for busy days).  
  - **Texas Roadhouse-style chili** (a restaurant-inspired version).  
  - **Chili without tomatoes** (aligning with the Wikipedia note about bean/tomato disputes).  
  - **Pulled pork chili** (using pork shoulder as an alternative to beef; 2–2.5 lbs recommended).  
- Includes references to Russian culinary sites ("Вкусная Еда") and generic terms like "cheap dinners for a family" or "red chili recipes."

| **Focus**                | Historical origins, regional distinctions, and cultural context.              | Practical home-cooking recipes and trending variations.                        |
| **Chili Types**          | Clearly differentiates *chili con carne* (Mexican stew) from *Cincinnati-style* (spaghetti/hot dog sauce). | Blurs distinctions; lists "pulled pork chili" or "Texas Roadhouse chili" without clarifying regional differences. |
| **Ingredients**          | Notes debates over beans/tomatoes; emphasizes traditional spices (cumin, garlic). | Highlights ingredient substitutions (e.g., pork shoulder instead of beef) and "chili without tomatoes." |
| **Cultural Context**     | Detailed history (Aztec origins, Spanish influence, 19th-century travelers).  | No historical context; focuses on modern recipe searches (e.g., "cheap dinners," "crockpot"). |
| **Purpose**              | Educational, authoritative breakdown of chili as a global dish with regional variations. | Practical guide for home cooks seeking quick, customizable recipes.            |

**Key Insight**:  
Wikipedia provides a **scholarly, structured overview** of chili’s evolution across cultures, while DuckDuckGo reflects **real-world recipe trends**—showing how home cooks adapt chili for convenience (crockpot), dietary preferences (no tomatoes), or protein swaps (pork). The two sources complement each other: Wikipedia explains *why* chili varies regionally, and DuckDuckGo shows *how* people cook it today. For example, the "chili without tomatoes" search aligns with Wikipedia’s historical disputes, but DuckDuckGo frames it as a modern cooking tip rather than a cultural debate.
