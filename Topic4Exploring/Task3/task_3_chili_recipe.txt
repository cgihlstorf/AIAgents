### Combined Summary

**From Wikipedia:**  
Chili con carne (commonly called "chili") is a spicy stew originating in Texas. Traditional recipes feature meat (typically beef), chili peppers, tomatoes, and spices like cumin and garlic. Authentic Texas-style chili traditionally excludes beans, though regional variations often include them. The dish is commonly served with toppings such as shredded cheese, sour cream, and cornbread. Wikipedia emphasizes its historical roots and cultural significance, noting it became popular across the U.S. in the 19th century and has since evolved into numerous regional adaptations.

**From DuckDuckGo:**  
DuckDuckGo search results highlight diverse, practical recipes from popular cooking sources:  
- **AllRecipes**: A quick "Classic Chili" using ground beef, kidney beans, diced tomatoes, onions, garlic, chili powder, and cumin. Simmered for 30 minutes.  
- **Food Network**: "Texas-Style Chili" with chuck roast (no beans), smoked paprika, and slow-cooked for 4+ hours for tender meat.  
- **Serious Eats**: A "Best Chili Recipe" combining ground beef and pork, tomato paste, coffee for depth, and a blend of spices, simmered for 2 hours.  
- **Vegetarian Options**: Recipes using black beans, lentils, bell peppers, and vegetable broth (e.g., from *BBC Good Food*), emphasizing plant-based protein and smoky flavors.

### Report: Comparison and Contrast  

**Similarities**:  
- Both sources agree on core ingredients like chili peppers, tomatoes, and cumin as foundational elements.  
- Texas-style chili is consistently noted as bean-free in both Wikipedia and DuckDuckGo results (e.g., Food Network’s recipe aligns with Wikipedia’s historical description).  

**Differences**:  
- **Context vs. Practicality**: Wikipedia focuses on historical and cultural context (e.g., origins in Texas, evolution over time), while DuckDuckGo provides actionable, modern recipes with specific measurements, cooking times, and techniques (e.g., adding coffee for richness or using slow cookers).  
- **Variations**: DuckDuckGo highlights more contemporary adaptations, such as vegetarian options and protein blends (e.g., beef-pork mix), which Wikipedia only mentions briefly as "regional variations."  
- **Bean Inclusion**: While Wikipedia states beans are *traditionally excluded* in Texas-style chili, DuckDuckGo shows that most popular recipes (e.g., AllRecipes) *include beans*, reflecting how the dish has evolved in home kitchens outside Texas.  

**Key Insight**:  
Wikipedia offers a scholarly overview of chili’s history and regional identity, whereas DuckDuckGo delivers a snapshot of how home cooks and chefs currently prepare it—showcasing creativity, dietary adaptations, and convenience-focused methods. For someone seeking to *make* chili, DuckDuckGo’s recipes are more immediately useful; for understanding its cultural significance, Wikipedia provides deeper context.
