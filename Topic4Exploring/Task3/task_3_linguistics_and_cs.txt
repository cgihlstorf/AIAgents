LangGraph ReAct Agent - Persistent Multi-Turn Conversation
================================================================================

This system uses create_react_agent with graph-based looping:
  - Single persistent conversation across all turns
  - History managed automatically (trimmed after 100 messages)
  - Loops via graph edges (no Python loops or checkpointing)

Commands:
  - Type 'quit' or 'exit' to end the conversation
  - Type 'verbose' to enable detailed tracing
  - Type 'quiet' to disable detailed tracing

### Summary from Wikipedia
Wikipedia's entry on **Computational Linguistics** describes it as an interdisciplinary field focused on computational modeling of natural language and computational approaches to linguistic questions. Key points include:
- **Interdisciplinary Roots**: Combines linguistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mathematics, logic, philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience.
- **Historical Context**: Originated in the 1950s with early machine translation efforts (e.g., translating Russian scientific journals into English). The term was formalized by David Hays in the 1970s–1980s, leading to the creation of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).
- **Applications**: 
  - Use of annotated corpora like the **Penn Treebank** (4.5M words of English with part-of-speech tagging and syntactic analysis).
  - Modeling language acquisition via robots and computational models (e.g., affordance-based word-meaning mappings without explicit grammar).
  - Integration of Noam Chomsky’s linguistic theories (e.g., Chomsky normal form) into computational models for grammar analysis.
- **Tools**: Includes software like spaCy, WordNet, and GloVe for natural language processing (NLP).
- **Current Scope**: Extends beyond translation to broader NLP tasks, including syntax, semantics, and language evolution modeling using mathematical frameworks like the Price equation.

### Summary from DuckDuckGo
DuckDuckGo’s search results highlight:
- **Mutual Benefit**: Computer science aids linguists in studying natural languages (e.g., through NLP tools), while linguistics informs computer science (e.g., structuring language models for AI).
- **Career Overlap**: Graduates can pursue roles in both fields, such as traditional computer science jobs or linguistics-focused positions (e.g., speech recognition, machine translation).
- **Academic Integration**: Programs like "Linguistics & Computer Science" allow students to explore human language from multiple perspectives, blending theoretical linguistics with computational techniques.
- **Core Idea**: Computers need linguistic insights to understand human language, and linguists rely on computational tools to analyze large-scale language data.

### Comparison and Contrast
- **Agreement**: Both sources emphasize the **interdisciplinary synergy** between linguistics and computer science, particularly through computational linguistics. They agree that the fields mutually benefit: linguistics provides structural insights into language, while computer science offers tools for analysis and modeling.
- **Depth and Focus**: 
  - **Wikipedia** provides **technical and historical depth**, detailing specific methodologies (e.g., Penn Treebank, Chomsky’s influence), tools (spaCy, WordNet), and real-world applications (language acquisition modeling, machine translation history).
  - **DuckDuckGo** offers a **broader, more accessible overview**, stressing career opportunities and the general reciprocal relationship between the fields without diving into technical specifics.
- **Unique Insights**: 
  - Wikipedia highlights **academic and research-oriented details** (e.g., mathematical frameworks for language evolution, robotics in linguistics testing).
  - DuckDuckGo underscores **practical implications**, such as how professionals apply this knowledge in industry roles (e.g., NLP engineers, speech technologists).

In summary, Wikipedia’s entry is ideal for understanding the **technical and scholarly foundations** of the field, while DuckDuckGo’s results better illustrate its **real-world relevance and career pathways**. Together, they paint a complete picture of how linguistics and computer science intersect to advance both theoretical and applied language technologies.
