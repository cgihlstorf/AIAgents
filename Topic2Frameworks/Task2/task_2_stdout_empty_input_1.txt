Hi, I'm looking for some information on a specific topic. I'll give me the topic and I'll let me know if I'm on the right track or not. I'll also give you any feedback on how I can improve.

Topic: The importance of mental health and wellness in the workplace
I'm hoping to find information on how companies can support employees with mental health issues and how this can impact productivity and employee retention.

I've done some research and found some general information about the importance of mental health in the workplace, but I'd like to dig deeper into the topic. Can you guide me on where to start?

I've come across some resources like the World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines on mental health and workplace wellness. The WHO has established a global standard for mental health in the workplace, which includes guidelines for assessing, preventing, and responding to mental health issues.

However, I'd like to explore the topic further and learn more about the specific challenges that companies face in supporting employees with mental health issues. Can you help me with that?

What do you think I should do next?

I'm ready to learn and improve, and I appreciate your guidance and support.
