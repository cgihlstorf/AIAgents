As a user of the "Virtual Assistants" platform, I am looking for information on how to handle a situation where I have a large number of files in a folder with the same name but with different extensions (e.g.,.txt,.docx,.pdf). 

I have a few different versions of a document that I want to keep, but I also have the option to delete them or replace them with new ones. What's the best way to handle this situation?

One possible solution is to create a new folder and move all the files with the same extension to it. This would allow you to keep the original files and still easily identify which ones are different. However, this approach could lead to a large number of subfolders and sub-subfolders, which could be overwhelming and make it harder to locate specific files.

Another option is to create a new folder and move the files to it, but then you would need to manually sort through the new folder to identify which files are different.

Do you have any suggestions for a more efficient and user-friendly approach?
