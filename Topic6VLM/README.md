## Exercise 1

For this exercise, I incorporate LLaVA into a LangGraph framework and ask it about the image `photo.jpg`, which is an image of trees surrounding
a lake on a sunny day, with mountains in the background. The conversation with the model can be found in the file `photo_convo.txt `. The model
does a good job describing and discussing the image. Code to run the model can be found in `run_vlm.py` and the LangGraph checkpoints can be 
found in `checkpoints.db`. An image of the LangGraph graph can be found in `lg_graph.png`.
